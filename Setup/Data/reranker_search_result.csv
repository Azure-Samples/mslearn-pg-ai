768356,"Uhl Bros. v. Hull","""Holcomb, J.\nAppellant, subtenant of a former lessee of a former owner of certain premises in Seattle, sued respondents, subsequent purchasers from the former owner of the property, for damages alleged to have been caused by water issuing from unprotected pipes upon portions of the premises over which respondents had exclusive control and appellant had none, claiming the total sum of $3,295.26.\nUpon issue being joined and the case tried, the court made findings of fact which explain the nature of the case as briefly as can be done. The findings are as follows:\n“I. On July 17, 1919, one George G. Gross was the owner of the building referred to in the complaint. It consisted of a basement, five storerooms fronting on Union Street, numbered from the corner store, which was No. 500 Union Street, easterly to the alley in the block, the other street numbers being 504, 506, 508 and 510, and a hotel on the floors above. On that date the owner leased to Converse Co. Inc., a corporation, the storeroom numbered 510 and all of the basement of the building, except a furnace room situate on the northeast corner of the basement. On April .30, 1921, the Converse Co. Inc., sublet to the plaintiff the northerly portion of such basement, and the possession under said lease and sub-lease continued in the lessee and sub-tenant respectively until after May 22, 1922.\n“II. On or about March 1, 1921, said store-room No. 506 was under lease from said Gross for a term then unexpired, and on the date last named the lessee thereof assigned his lease to one Stockhoff, who took possession of the leased premises and remained there in possession until on or about June 30,1921.\n“III. At the time Stockhoff moved in there was no water connection in or to said store-room No. 506. He installed a water supply in said store-room. This supply was by means of two half-inch pipes running between the floor of No. 506 and the ceiling of the basement shortly thereafter occupied by the plaintiff. One of these pipes was connected with the cold water system by tapping the pipe which supplied cold water to a sink or basin theretofore and now located toward the rear or western end of a hall-way which extended along the rear of said store-room No. 504, 506, 508 and 510. The flow of water at the point of connection was controlled by a cut-off then separately installed for that purpose. That hall-way was used in common by the tenants of said store-rooms numbered 506, 508 and 510, and by the basement tenants other than the tenant of the furnace room. Said cold water pipe extended from under said sink down beneath the floor of the hall-way and thence through an opening in the partition and into said space between said floor and ceiling for a distance of 20 feet or thereabouts. It then had an elbow deflecting it up to and through the floor of No. 506. The hot water pipe paralleled the course of the cold water pipe in said space between ceiling and floor, and turned by an elbow at the same point and passed up through the floor into said storeroom. The method of this installation was not known to said Gross or his agents. On or about August 1, 1921, the said Gross leased No. 506 to one O’Brien, who thereupon moved in and remained there until about May 1, 1922. From thence until after May 22, 1922, said store-room No. 506 remained vacant. All of that water connection which extended above the floor was taken out by Stoekkoff when he moved out. Shortly after O ’Brien moved in all that was visible of the same was the two holes in the floor referred to, and a hole for the waste pipe and each of the two first-named contained a cap such as is used in plumbing for capping a half-inch pipe. In December, 1921, the defendants bought said building from said Gross and conveyance being made accordingly. At that time and thereafter until May 22, 1922, the condition last above described as existing in said room No. 506 continued without change.\n“IV. On the night of May 20, and during May 21st and the early hours of May 22, 1922, the stock of wall paper of the plaintiff stored in said portion of basement occupied by the plaintiff became damaged by water escaping on to it from the ceiling above. A plumber employed in the emergency crawled with difficulty into the opening above referred to and, dragging his body along the said two pipes to the end of the same, discovered the cause was that said cold water pipe was open at its extremity. Some person unknown maliciously or otherwise disposed (not the plaintiff nor either of the defendants nor any employee or agent of them or either of them nor the tenant of No. 508) had turned the cutoff under the sink aforesaid so that the water flowed out through that pipe over onto the basement ceiling and through it upon said stock of goods. At that time the caps aforesaid, screwed on to nipples, remained in the floor above, extending down through the floor, but there was a gap between the top of the elbow and the bottom of the nipple of about one foot. How this condition came about, the evidence does not disclose. A preponderance of the evidence is that it existed from the time Stockhoff moved out.\n“V. Neither the said Gross nor the defendants nor the plaintiff nor any agent of either ever knew of the existence of that condition until after it was repaired on the morning of May 22,1922, and in the exercise of ordinary prudence none of them could have discovered it. The existence and location of the caps in the floor visible from above indicated that the water supply had been properly protected by caps so that water could not escape from the supply pipes and any person viewing the same would have been justified in so concluding. The space between the floor and ceiling above referred to was in total darkness so that the condition at the end of the pipes was only discoverable in the manner in which it was discovered as aforesaid and then only by carrying artificial light into the place. The cut-off under the sink was of the ordinary type, but was not visible to one observing the sink except by the intrusion below the sink of artificial light. Access to said sink was open during business hours. The entrance to said hallway from outside the building was controlled by said Converse Co., and whenever that company closed its establishment said door was locked. It was so locked at about five P. M. of May 20th.\n“VI. The water was flowing at eight o’clock on said Saturday night, but the evidence does not show when the flow began, the preponderance being that the flow commenced between five and eight o ’clock of that day. During that period of time the access to the sink was possible only to the occupants or visitors to said store-rooms numbered 508 and 510. The fact that water was escaping was not discovered until eight o’clock on said Monday morning.”\nUpon these findings the court concluded that appellant had no right of recovery.\nAppellant excepted to certain findings made by the court and to the refusal of the court to make findings requested by it. The errors claimed are:\n1. In finding that the condition of the water connections and the pipe ends in the floor of No. 506 gave no notice of the dangerous defect.\n2. In finding that the defendants and their agents knew nothing of the condition of the pipes until after the accident.\n3. In refusing to find it to be the duty of the defendants to have made careful examination of the plumbing and water pipes, especially those indicated by the holes in the floor of No. 506; and in refusing to find that the defendants were guilty of negligence in not so doing.\n4. In entering judgment in favor of defendants; and that the findings do not sustain the judgment.\n5. In overruling the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.\nThere is no error in either of the findings first assailed, for the evidence sustains them. In fact, as to the1 first claim there is no contradiction in the evidence; and as to the second claimed error, the only claim is that of imputed notice to the former owner and his agent, which cannot be imputed to the later one, who had no actual notice.\nThe principal point of contention is upon the third assignment.\nUnder this claim appellant contends that the owner of the premises is an insurer of his tenant in one part of the premises for damages flowing from a defect in another part of the premises which other part is under the control of the owner and not under the control of the tenant. Cases from other jurisdictions are cited and it is insisted that the case of Le Vette v. Hardman Estate, 77 Wash. 320, 137 Pac. 454, L. R. A. 1917B 222, sustains that contention.\nAppellant is in error. By reference to the Le Vette case, it will he found that the basis of the complaint was negligence. There was some evidence to show negligence on the part of the landlord, but the trial court dismissed the action by the tenant on granting the nonsuit. This court held that the failure to exercise proper superintendence over the upper story of the building in question might be held to be negligence, and that at least it was a question that should have been submitted to the jury.\nThat is not the case here. In this case the trial judge heard the witnesses and resolved the evidence against the allegations of negligence upon competent and credible evidence. He also found that respondents had no notice of the defect, and that the defects in the plumbing could not be discovered by ordinary care and prudence. He viewed the premises himself and was able to judge of the conditions accurately.\nWe have never held that a landlord is an insurer of the premises of the tenant, but in fact have held to the contrary, as in the LeVette case, supra, that the landlord is bound to ordinary care only, and liable only for negligence for lack of such care. Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873.\nAnd a sub-tenant has no greater rights against the owner than has his immediate landlord, the sub-lessor. Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 917; Hogan v. Metropolitan Building Co., 120 Wash. 82, 206 Pac. 959.\nThe judgment is right and it is affirmed.\nMain, C. J., Tolman, Mackintosh, and Parker, JJ., concur."""
615468,"Le Vette v. Hardman Estate","""Morris, J.\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\n“That the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor’s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.”\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, § 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant’s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be’held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\nCrow, C. J., Parker, Fullerton, and Mount, JJ., concur."""
4912975,"Conradi v. Arnold","""Beals, J.\nIda Mae Conradi, as executrix of the will of William E. Conradi, deceased, and personally, instituted this action against Grant Arnold and Elizabeth Arnold, his wife, asking for judgment for damages on each of two separate causes of action stated in the second amended complaint, hereinafter referred to as the complaint.\nThe first cause of action was brought under the survival statute, Rem. Rev. Stat, § 194 [P.P.C. § 3-43], as set forth in the complaint, plaintiff demanding judgment against the defendants for $10,380, on account of pain and suffering sustained by her deceased husband during his lifetime because of the alleged negligence of defendants, together with expenses incurred during the last illness of the deceased.\nBy her second cause of action, plaintiff demanded judgment against defendants for fifteen thousand dollars, on account of the loss of prospective earnings by Mr. Conradi during his reasonable life expectancy, for the benefit of plaintiff and Mr. Conradi’s surviving daughter, together with ten thousand dollars by way of damages suffered by plaintiff and Mr. Conradi’s daughter, occasioned by the death of Mr. Conradi. Plaintiff also demanded judgment in the further sum of five hundred dollars on account of the expenses of Mr. Conradi’s funeral, making a total of $25,-500, based upon her second cause of action.\nIn her complaint, plaintiff alleged that, prior to January 23, 1948, plaintiff and the late William E. Conradi were husband and wife, residing as tenants in a third-floor apartment in a building owned and operated by defendants Arnold; that, on October 7, 1947, at about ten minutes after six o’clock a. m., Mr. Conradi proceededdo leave the apartment and was about to descend the stairway leading therefrom to the second floor; that the entire stairway was under the control of defendants; that, due to the negligence of defendants in maintaining the stairway, it was in a dangerous and unsafe condition; and that Mr. Conradi slipped and fell from the top of the stairway down approximately sixteen steps to the landing beyond the lower step thereof.\nPlaintiff pleaded certain ordinances of the city of Seattle relating to buildings, the construction and lighting thereof, and the maintenance of a healthful temperature therein, and alleged that the stairway was defective in certain named particulars (hereinafter referred to); that, as a result of the fall, Mr. Conradi suffered severe injuries and thereafter endured great pain; that the fall was the proximate cause of Mr. Conradi’s death, which occurred January 23, 1948, and that Mr. Conradi’s suffering and death proximately resulted from defendants’ negligence.\nPlaintiff also alleged in her complaint that, about the middle of December, 1947, defendants served upon Mr. Conradi and the plaintiff notices terminating their tenancy and requiring them to surrender possession of the apartment January 15, 1948; that she and her husband complied with this notice; and that, in moving, Mr. Conradi lifted many heavy boxes and other articles, to his further injury.\nBy their answer to plaintiff’s complaint, the defendants admitted the existence of the ordinances of the city of Seattle pleaded by plaintiff; that Mr. and Mrs. Conradi were their tenants; that Mr. Conradi fell and was injured; and that he died on the date alleged, but denied the other material allegations of the complaint and particularly that plaintiff had suffered damage as the result of any negligence on the part of the defendants.\nBy way of an affirmative defense, the defendants alleged that any injuries sustained by Mr. Conradi or by the plaintiff were solely caused by and resulted from Mr. Conradi’s own contributory negligence.\nBy her reply, plaintiff denied the affirmative allegations contained in defehdants’ answer.\nThe action was tried to the court, sitting without a jury, and, after having personally inspected the premises, the trial judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the defendants, followed by the entry of a judgment in favor of defendants, dismissing plaintiff’s action with prejudice. From this judgment, plaintiff has appealed, making the following assignment of errors:\n“ (1) The Superior Court erred in finding that William E. Conradi was fully familiar with the condition of the hallway, including the rug or strip of carpet, the bare floor and the conditions thereof (Finding No. III).\n“ (2) The Superior Court erred in finding that William E. Conradi was guilty of contributory negligence (Findings No. IV and V).\n“(3) The Superior Court erred in finding that there is no evidence that any negligent or unlawful act on the part of the respondents was a proximate cause of Conradi’s death (Finding No. VII).\n“ (4) The Superior Court erred in making its Conclusion of Law that the respondents were guilty of no negligent or unlawful act which was a proximate cause of the death of Conradi (Conclusion No. I).\n“(5) The Superior Court erred in making its Conclusion of Law that the complaint of appellant should be dismissed with prejudice and that respondents should be allowed judgment against appellant for their costs (Conclusion No. II).\n“(6) The Superior Court erred in entering judgment in favor of respondents and against appellant, dismissing appellant’s complaint and awarding costs against her.\n“(7) The Superior Court erred in overruling appellant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the oral decision.\n“(8) The Superior Court erred in overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial.”\nThe late William E. Conradi and the appellant herein, Ida Mae Conradi, were for many years husband and wife, and were the parents of Mrs. Thomas Long.\nThe respondents Grant and Elizabeth Arnold are husband and wife, and, as a marital community, owned an apartment building known as No. 5808 Fifteenth avenue northeast, in the city of Seattle. They occupied an apartment in the building and rented the other apartments.\nDuring the month of April, 1947, Mrs. Conradi, on behalf of the community composed of herself and her husband, rented from respondents apartment No. 9, on a month-to-month basis, it being understood that respondents would supply electricity and heat. Mr. and Mrs. Conradi took possession of their apartment, which they occupied until January 15, 1948, when they departed, as will be hereinafter set forth.\nApartment No. 9 was on the third floor of the building and was accessible only by way of a rather steep flight of stairs, consisting of sixteen steps. In this opinion, we shall refer to the left and right sides of the stairway from the standpoint of a person leaving the apartment to descend the stairs. On the left-hand side of the stairway was a vertical wall, and on the right-hand side was a bannister. The flight of stairs ended at the top at the door opening into the apartment. There was no stair landing whatever on the outside of this door. One leaving the apartment to go downstairs would step from the floor in the doorway down the first step of the stairway. The door to the apartment opened inward, to the left of one leaving the apartment. The floor of the apartment was of hardwood, and was bare for a distance of ten or twelve inches on the approach to the door from within the apartment. The floor extended under the door and for a distance of only two or three inches beyond the door toward the stairway. The edge of the floor next to the stairway consisted of a narrow strip of hardwood, and there was testimony to the effect that this portion of the floor was somewhat loose and would tilt a little when a person placed his weight thereon. Respondents’ testimony was to the effect that the strip referred to was not loose.\nThere was also testimony to the effect that the bare portion of the apartment floor was somewhat slippery. Appellant testified that she kept the hardwood floor of the apartment, between the end of the rug or carpet and the door to the apartment, cleaned and polished, and that, on several occasions, she had observed that someone was cleaning or polishing that portion of the floor which projected beyond the door.\nOn the staircase wall, to the right of a person leaving the apartment and at a convenient elevation above the bannister rail, was a short handrail, to be used until the person descending the stairs reached a position where use of the bannister rail was convenient. It appeared that, at the time of Mr. Conradi’s accident, this handrail was somewhat loose. However, it may be noted that it does not appear that, on the occasion of the accident, Mr. Conradi took hold of this rail.\nThere was an electric light on the first floor at the foot of the second flight of steps, when descending, but this light could be turned on only by a switch on the ground floor. It also appears that this light was generally not turned on.\nUpon the ceiling of the apartment, just inside the door, was an electric light which was controlled by a push button on the wall of the stairway, outside the door of the apartment. Consequently, anyone desiring to descend from the apartment with the aid of this light would be required to open the door, stand on the top step of the stairway (which, as above stated, was the floor of the apartment), or descend one step, then reach to his right and press the light switch to turn on the light, which, while the door was open, would illuminate at least the upper portion of the stairway.\nThe apartment door did not open on the middle of the stairway (all as shown by a photograph which was introduced in evidence), but somewhat to the right of the center thereof, as a person descended. The center portion of the stairway was covered with a stair carpet, but, as shown by a photograph, this carpet did not coincide exactly with the doorway. The floor carpet or rug in the apartment hall did not extend to the door, but ended at the distance from the door above mentioned.\nThere was a window, apparently covered by a light curtain, on the landing at the foot of the stairs, but this window afforded little, if any, aid in lighting the stairway during hours of dusk. It would seem that the stairway was, at all times, rather dark, unless the light, above referred to, within the apartment, was turned on and the apartment door was open.\nThe photographs of the stairway, door, and so forth, which were offered as exhibits by respondents and received in evidence, were taken during the month of December, 1947.\nMr. Conradi was employed as an engineer on a cannery tender operating in Alaskan waters. He would be at home for a day or so at intervals of about two weeks. On the morning of October 7, 1947, Mr. Conradi arose, and, at a few minutes after six o’clock, standard time, started to leave the apartment. No lights were turned on in the apartment. The light at the foot of the stairway on the first floor was not turned on, and Mr. Conradi, as Mrs. Conradi testified at the trial, opened the apartment door and, while standing on the floor of the apartment, reached for the light switch on the stairway wall to the right of the door for the purpose of turning on the light within the apartment, which would illuminate the stairway. As Mr. Conradi turned, he fell down the staircase. Mrs. Conradi, who saw her husband fall, hurried to the landing at the foot of the stairs, where she found Mr. Conradi lying with his back resting against the lower step. The loose rug on the landing was wrapped around his legs. Mrs. Conradi released her husband from the rug, and, notwithstanding her protests, he insisted upon going to work and departed.\nA witness, Carrie McGranahan (who was not previously acquainted with Mr. Conradi), while waiting on the street for transportation to her place of employment, saw bim fall to his knees after attempting to open a garage door. The witness asked Mr. Conradi if he had suffered a heart attack and offered to assist him. Mr. Conradi told her that he had just fallen down a flight of stairs, but that he did not require help. She saw him enter the garage, apparently still in distress.\nAt about three o’clock in the afternoon, or a little later, Mrs. Conradi, hearing a noise outside the apartment, opened the door and found her husband slowly ascending the stairs. He told her that he had left his work as soon as his assistant had arrived to reheve him. That evening, with the assistance of Mr. Conradi’s son-in-law, who carried Mr. Conradi down the stairs to his car, the injured man was taken to a doctor, who, by means of X rays, ascertained that Mr. Conradi’s right heel bone had been crushed. A cast was applied, and, about two weeks thereafter, Mr. Conradi was taken to a hospital, where an operation was performed upon his injured foot and another cast was applied, which reached to his hip. He remained in the cast for almost nine weeks thereafter. Mr. Conradi also complained of an injury to his back, and sustained some severe bruises. Although he suffered much pain, Mr. Conradi apparently made substantial progress toward a recovery.\nDecember 15th, respondents served upon each of the Conradis a notice requiring them to vacate the apartment within thirty days. Mr. Conradi’s leg was still in a cast, and, in the effort to find another place to live, he became tired, lost weight, and showed signs of physical deterioration.\nThe trial court, over respondents’ objection, permitted appellant to introduce testimony in connection with the notices to quit, which respondents served upon Mr. Con-radi and appellant, and also admitted testimony concerning the physical efforts which Mr. Conradi exerted in moving from the apartment. The same is true as to testimony regarding the degree of heat furnished the apartment by respondents, appellant contending that the heat was insufficient to keep the apartment warm. The court reserved its ruling as to the admissibility of all this testimony, but never finally passed upon this question, as the action was dismissed upon the merits.\nDuring argument upon the admissibility of the testimony, appellant’s counsel referred to certain Federal statutes and regulations concerning the dispossession of tenants, but no such statutes or regulations were pleaded nor were any introduced in evidence.\nIn connection with the notices to terminate tenancy served by respondents, appellant testified that she had consulted her attorney, who advised her to see the local office of price administration authorities. Mrs. Conradi testified that she followed this advice, taking the notices to the OPA office, where, in response to questions, she detailed the circumstances, but was told that “there was nothing they could do.” It does not appear that either Mr. or Mrs. Conradi took any further legal steps to contest the •termination of tenancy.\nRespondents were requested to permit the Conradis to continue to occupy the apartment until they could find a suitable place to live, but respondents insisted that the apartment be vacated by the evening of January 15, 1948. In order to meet this deadline, the Conradis were required to work hard, packing and moving. Although they engaged movers to carry their possessions from the apartment, Mr. Conradi became extremely fatigued from walking up and down the stairs, and exerted himself to a great degree in unloading goods from their car, some for storage at his daughter’s residence, and other articles at their new place of abode.\nAfter moving (January 15th), Mr. Conradi’s physical condition deteriorated, and, January 23rd, while driving his automobile from his- daughter’s home to the Conradi residence, he suffered a heart attack, dying almost immediately.\nAt the time of his death, Mr. Conradi was sixty-two years of age. He was a trained machinist and diesel engineer, and had been employed both at sea and on shore. He had suffered from diabetes since 1939, but apparently this disease had not interfered with his work. It appears that he had also suffered from a heart ailment for some time, but this condition was not known until an autopsy was performed. At his age, Mr. Conradi had a normal life expectancy of something over twelve years.\nAt the close of the testimony, the trial court delivered its oral decision, stating that “evidence in volumes” had been received, over objections, and that the time of argument had not been limited. The decision also states that, at the request of counsel (at the close of appellant’s case), the court had examined the premises, climbing up the stairway to the apartment, and obtaining firsthand knowledge of the situation. The court called attention to the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Conradi had occupied the apartment for six months and were thoroughly acquainted with the staircase and its appurtenances.\nThe court strongly criticized respondents for serving notices upon the Conradis to move from the premises and also for the rather objectionable terms in which the notices were drawn, the phraseology being such as would be humiliating to the Conradis.\nThe court also called attention to the fact that, when the Conradis moved, Mr. Conradi underwent some rather extraordinary physical exertion in connection with the moving, thereby exhausting his energy, but observed that Mr. Con-radi did this as a matter of his own choice.\nIn summing up the situation, the trial court was of the opinion that, in view of Mr. Conradi’s thorough knowledge of the stairway, it should be held that his own negligence contributed to his fall, and that respondents were not liable for other matters of which appellant complains. The court then stated that the action would be dismissed.\nAfter finding that appellant was the administratrix of the estate of her late husband, and that respondents were the owners and operators of the apartment house in question, the trial court entered finding No. 2, which reads as follows:\n“That located on the third floor of the apartment building of the defendants is a certain apartment which the plaintiff Ida Mae Conradi and her husband, William E. Conradi, occupied under a month-to-month tenancy from April 18, 1947, to January 15, 1948; that from the second floor of the apartment building a stairway extends 16 steps upward to a door which provides the sole means of ingress and egress to the apartment rented by the plaintiff and her husband; that this stairway was maintained for the sole use of and used solely by the tenants in the said third-floor apartment and their visitors, and constituted a necessary and sole approach to the premises.”\nBy finding No. 3, the court established the facts concerning the floor of the apartment to the outside edge thereof, the operation of the door as above set forth, and that\n“ . . . the condition of the floor of the said apartment hallway was exactly the same and had not changed in any way from April 18, 1947, to October 7, 1947; that the said William E. Conradi was fully familiar with the condition of the hallway, including the rug or strip carpet, the bare floor and the condition thereof.”\nFindings Nos. 4 and 5 read as follows:\n“(4) That on the 7th day of October, 1947, at about 6:05 to 6:10 a. m. William E. Conradi, while about to leave the apartment to proceed on his way to work, was standing within the hallway in his apartment, with the door to the stairway open, and at a point near the edge of that part of the hall floor nearest the stairway, when as a result of his own negligence he slipped and fell to the bottom of the stairway, resulting in certain injuries to him; that the hallway, doorway and stairway were then dark and in order to illuminate the same it was necessary for William E. Con-radi to turn to his right to reach the electric switch on the wall and the stairway just outside the doorway leading into the apartment hall; that the said William E. Conradi did so turn and reach for said switch and in so doing he fell to the bottom of the stairway.\n“(5)' That the proximate cause of the fall of the said William E. Conradi and the injuries resulting therefrom was his own contributory negligence; that he was negligent in failing to take heed of the bare floor of the hallway on which he slipped, thereby causing his fall.”\nThe court then continued by finding the service by respondents upon Mr. and Mrs. Conradi of the notices to vacate the apartment, and other circumstances in connection with those notices, this finding concluding as follows:\n“. . . that in connection with said move the said William E. Conradi elected to and did lift certain boxes containing household goods and a heavy tool chest.”\nFinding No. 7 reads as follows:\n“That thereafter on January 23, 1948, William E. Con-radi died from acute cardiac failure; that there is no evidence that any negligent or unlawful act on the part of the defendants was a proximate cause of his death, but that a proximate and contributing cause of his death was his fall down the stairs on October 7, 1947.”\nFrom the findings entered, the trial court concluded “That the defendants were guilty of no negligent or unlawful act which was a proximate cause of the death of William E. Conradi on January 23, 1948,” and that the action should be dismissed with prejudice.\nThe court then signed the judgment dismissing the action, from which this appeal is prosecuted.\nThe autopsy performed after Mr. Conradi’s death indicated that for some time he had suffered from a bad heart condition. It nowhere appears that Mr. Conradi had any knowledge of the fact that he was suffering from any such affliction, and there can be no question but that his death was the result of acute cardiac failure. Of course, his fall would tend to render this condition more serious, and undoubtedly his strenuous physical exertions in moving from the apartment to a new location would be injurious, in view of his unfortunate cardiac condition. It is not denied that, during the moving operation, Mr. Conradi worked hard and moved heavy objects, including a tool chest. It does not appear that he could not have obtained any desired assistance in moving, but evidently he voluntarily assumed this burden.\nThe findings of the trial court in an action at law are presumed to be correct and, on appeal, will be approved by this court unless we find that they are against the weight of the evidence. Wade v. Bartek, 30 Wn. (2d) 483, 191 P. (2d) 701; Graham v. Roderick, 32 Wn. (2d) 427, 202 P. (2d) 253; Fountain v. Parnell, 32 Wn. (2d) 599, 202 P. (2d) 918.\nHaving lived in the apartment for several months, Mr. Conradi was, of course, thoroughly familiar with the condition of the floor of the apartment, the door leading therefrom, the stairway to the second floor, and the lights available for illuminating those areas. It does not appear that the fact that the upper handrail was somewhat loose anywise contributed to Mr. Conradi’s fall.\nAppellant makes much of the evidence introduced on her behalf to the effect that, after Mr. Conradi’s fall, the narrow board at the edge of the apartment floor was somewhat reduced in width and rendered firm in its position, but this would not change the situation with which Mr. Conradi was perfectly familiar prior to his accident. Mr. and Mrs. Conradi accepted the apartment and the means of ingress and egress in connection therewith, and, although they did complain of inadequate heat and electricity, it does not appear that their complaints extended to any floor condition. Appellant testified that she had slipped on the floor and had so advised her husband. Her daughter, Mrs. Long, and the latter’s husband, testified that they had noticed that the floor was slippery. Miss Anna Steendahl, a high school teacher and a friend of the Conradis, called as a witness on appellant’s behalf, testified that the apartment floor was slippery. From the evidence, it appears that appellant cleaned the floor of the apartment up to the door.\nRespondent Grant Arnold testified that there had been no structural changes made in connection with apartment No. 9 since 1925. Respondents Arnold both testified that the portion of the floor of the apartment which projected beyond the door was never polished by them during appellant’s tenancy (as above stated, appellant testified to the contrary), and that the apartment and the stairway remained in exactly the same condition at all times after appellant and her husband took possession.\nAll conditions concerning apartment No. 9 and the staircase leading thereto from the second floor-were open and apparent. It is not contended that respondents made any agreement with Mr. and Mrs. Conradi to alter or repair any portion of the demised premises or that respondents were requested to do so. It nowhere appears that' there was any concealment on the part of respondents of the existing conditions. Inconvenient as the exit from the apartment was, the situation was at all times open and apparent, and thoroughly understood by the tenants. Respondents denied that the edge of the floor projecting beyond the door was loose, but, in any event, there is no evidence to the effect that the Conradis ever requested that any change or repair be made.\nThe general rule is stated in 2 Restatement of the Law of Torts 967, § 356, as follows:\n“Except as stated in §§ 357 to 362, a lessor of land is not liable for bodily harm caused to his lessee or others upon the land with the consent of the lessee or a sub-lessee by any dangerous condition whether natural or artificial which existed when the lessee took possession.”\nIn 32 Am. Jur. 515, § 654, appears the following:\n“A lessee takes the hired premises, in the absence of warranty, fraud, or misrepresentation, in the condition and quality in which they are. The tenant takes the property as he finds it, with all existing defects which he knows or can ascertain by reasonable inspection. He takes the risk of apparent defects. As between himself and his landlord, where there is no fraud or false representation or deceit, and in the absence of an express warranty or covenant to repair, there is no implied contract that the premises are suitable or fit for occupation, or for the particular use intended, or that they are safe for use. Any implied contract relates only to the estate, and not to the condition, of the property. In other words, in the absence of fraud or concealment on the part of the landlord, a rule similar to that of caveat emptor applies and throws upon the lessee the responsibility of examining as to the existence of defects in the premises and of providing against their ill effects.”\nIn 16 R. C. L. 1030, § 552, the text states that, under the common law, it is well settled that the landlord is under no obligation “in the absence of a covenant to that effect, to repair the demised premises, even where they become defective through decay or deterioration.” At p. 1034, § 555, it is stated that “a landlord not under contract to repair is not responsible to the tenant for injuries to person or property caused by defects in the rented premises.” See, also, 52 C. J. S. 12, § 417.\nIn 1 Tiffany Real Property (3rd ed.) 158, § 104, the rule is stated as follows:\n“Since the tenant is bound to inspect beforehand, and is subject to the rule of caveat emptor, and the landlord owes no duty to repair, the latter is, in general, not hable for injuries to the tenant or his property resulting from the construction or condition of the demised premises.”\nThis rule is, of course, subject to certain exceptions in connection with hidden defects or acts of a landlord after the initiation of the tenancy.\nIn the case of Moore v. Weber (1872), 71 Pa. St. 429, in reversing a judgment for the plaintiff, the court held that\n“In the absence of an express agreement there is no implied obligation on the landlord to repair demised premises, . . . The rule here, as in other cases, is caveat emptor. The lessee’s eyes are his bargain. He is bound to examine the premises he rents, and secure himself by covenants, to repair and rebuild.”\nThis case has been frequently cited and followed by courts of other jurisdictions.\nIn the case of Brown v. Dwight Manufacturing Co., 200 Ala. 376, 76 So. 292, the court quoted from the case of Moore v. Weber, supra, and held that the landlord was under no obligation to keep demised premises in repair, in the absence of an agreement to do so.\nThe case last cited was followed by the court of appeals of Alabama in Lusco v. Jackson, 27 Ala. App. 531, 175 So. 566.\nThe supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in the case of Pittsley v. Acushnet Saw Mills Co., 299 Mass. 252, 12 N. E. (2d) 823, an action by an administratrix of the estate of a deceased person, who had suffered death as the result of an accident on leased premises, held that the landlord was not liable for damages resulting from an accident caused by a hidden defect in the demised premises, there having been “no express or implied warranty by the defendant that the premises were free from defects, nor did it misrepresent the condition of the premises.”\nIn Breazeale v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 293 Ill. App. 269, 12 N. E. (2d) 217, the court held that a landlord was not responsible to his tenant for injuries suffered from a fall caused by the tenant’s foot catching in an open seam in the carpet in a leased apartment. In the course of the opinion, the court said:\n“The general rule is that where the right of possession and enjoyment of leased premises passes to the lessee, in the absence of concealment or fraud by the landlord as to some defect known to him and unknown to the tenant, the tenant assumes all risk of personal injury from defects, and the fact that the lessor covenants to repair does not affect this rule so far as concerns the lessor’s liability for personal injuries to the lessee due to defects, although their existence is attributable to the failure of the lessor to repair.”\nThis court has several times considered questions concerning the liability of a landlord for injuries to a tenant, occasioned by defects in the leased premises.\nIn the early case of Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N.S.) 917, in an opinion by Ellis, J., many authorities are considered. A judgment entered against the landlord upon the verdict of a jury was affirmed. One paragraph of the opinion reads as follows (p. 446):\n“It is a general principle that, in the absence of express contract to the contrary, a tenant takes the demised premises as he finds them and there is no implied warranty by the landlord that they are safe or fit for the purpose for which they are hired. The maxim caveat emptor applies.”\nIn Larson v. Eldridge, 153 Wash. 23, 279 Pac. 120, a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, a subtenant of the defendant’s tenant, for damages suffered by the plaintiff because of the breaking of a balcony railing was reversed, the court relying upon the foregoing quotation from the opinion in Mesher v. Osborne, supra, and holding that no obligation rested upon the landlord and that the landlord was not liable for damages resulting from the breaking of the defective railing.\nIn the case of Miller v. Vance Lumber Co., 167 Wash. 348, 9 P. (2d) 351, this court also reversed a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff tenants, in an action for damages based upon personal injuries suffered by one of the plaintiffs because of faulty plaster on the ceiling of one room of a rented apartment.\nSomewhat similar questions were considered in the case of Peterson v. Betts, 24 Wn. (2d) 376, 165 P. (2d) 95, in which this court, sitting En Banc, after citing many authorities, reversed a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, entered pursuant to the verdict of a jury, in an action by a tenant against his landlord for personal injuries suffered by the tenant upon the demised premises.\nThe cases of Baker v. Moeller, 52 Wash. 605, 101 Pac. 231, Polk v. Spokane Interstate Fair, 73 Wash. 610, 132 Pac. 401, Hogan v. Metropolitan Building Co., 120 Wash. 82, 206 Pac. 959, Viles v. Thunborg, 164 Wash. 190, 2 P. (2d) 666, and Dodak v. Lewis, 187 Wash. 138, 59 P. (2d) 1121, are also in point.\nAppellant relies upon the opinion of this court in the case of Andrews v. McCutcheon, 17 Wn. (2d) 340, 135 P. (2d) 459, in which a judgment in favor of the plaintiff wife, on account of injuries suffered by her as the result of a fall down a flight of stairs in a shoe store in the possession and under the control of the defendant, was affirmed. The jury found that the defendant retained control over the stairway in question and failed to keep it in a reasonably safe condition for use by invitees. The evidence introduced was sufficient to support the jury’s finding of negligence on the part of the defendant in maintaining the staircase. The case is not here in point. .\nUnder the evidence in the case at bar, the staircase from the third floor to the second was appurtenant to the apartment, being exclusively for the use of tenants of the apartment and their guests. The treads of the staircase were carpeted, there was a bannister, and, apparently, the staircase itself was free from dangerous elements. Appellant contends that Mr. Conradi’s accident was the result of the situation' existing in the apartment and the connection of the apartment floor with the stairway. The center of the first stair tread below the apartment floor was covered by the stair carpet, which, apparently, was in good condition.\nEven though respondents assumed the burden of sweeping and cleaning the flight of stairs, the stairway was, nevertheless, entirely appurtenant to apartment No. 9, and, as above stated, Mr. Conradi’s fall was not the result of any condition on the stairway-below the floor of-the apartment.\nIt does not appear that the Conradis ever requested or suggested any change in the operation of the light which illuminated the stairway. It would seem that it would have been a very simple matter to have arranged for the turning on and off of that light from within the apartment, by attaching a switch and cord to the light socket, but, apparently, no such suggestion was ever made.\nAppellant herself cleaned and polished the uncarpeted portion of the floor within the apartment and must also have cleaned the portion of the floor under the door. She testified that respondents cleaned or polished the two-inch strip outside of the door.\nThe entire situation, with all of its inconveniences and dangers, was at all times open and apparent, and Mr. and Mrs. Conradi rented the apartment and used the same for the period stated. If the outer strip of the floor was loose, it does not appear that respondents knew of that fact and it is not contended that their attention was ever called to the situation.\nAppellant could recover judgment against respondents only if they were in some way negligent and Mr. Conradi was not contributively negligent. No negligence on the part of respondents is affirmatively shown by the record before us.\nThe trial court patiently listened to the evidence, admitting practically all of the testimony offered by appellant and reserving its rulings upon the competency and materiality of the portions of the testimony to which respondents objected. The court then, at appellant’s request, made a personal examination of the apartment and, from that examination, acquired knowledge of the situation which we do not have.\nThe trial court then found that Mr. Conradi’s injuries resulted from his own contributory negligence, and that no negligent or unlawful act on the part of respondents was a proximate cause of Mr. Conradi’s death.\nThe statement of facts closes with the trial court’s oral summation of the evidence and the statement that the case would be dismissed “for want of proof.”\nThe record does not disclose that appellant submitted any proposed findings, or requested any particular finding which the court refused.\nAppellant pleaded, by title, ordinance No. 72200 (the building ordinance) of the city of Seattle, as amended. Sections 20 (providing a penalty), 604, and 611 of the ordinance were read into the record.\nSection 604 refers to the surface material of stair treads, appellant contending that the ordinance had been violated because the top step of the stairway was “waxed and greased.” The court made no finding upon this matter. By “top step,” appellant undoubtedly referred to the floor of the apartment, as the first step of the stairway proper was covered with stair carpet. There is no question but that the floor of the apartment was cleaned and polished by appellant herself.\nSection 605 of the ordinance requires that apartment doors open on landings. No violation of this section of the ordinance was pleaded, and the court made no finding of fact thereon. Respondent Grant Arnold testified that no structural change in the apartment had been made since 1925. The question of whether the ordinance was applicable to the situation was not argued, and the court made no finding of fact in connection therewith.\nSection 611 of the ordinance provides for adequate lighting of stairways, and was read into the record. The trial court found that, at the time Mr. Conradi fell, the staircase was not lighted. Of course, Mr. Conradi fell during his attempt to turn on the light. The light was available,- and, under all the circumstances of this case, the ordinance is inapplicable.\nAppellant also pleaded, by title, city ordinance No. 39104, as amended, which requires the heating of occupied apartments, and so forth. No violation of this ordinance was pleaded in the complaint, and the ordinance is not applicable to the situation disclosed by the record. Appellant testified that the apartment was not comfortably warm and that Mr. Conradi caught a cold, but in view of the evidence in the record, the fact that Mr. Conradi had a cold is not pertinent.\nExamination of the evidence convinces us that Mr. and Mrs. Conradi leased the apartment as it was, and that they occupied it for the period above referred to, with full knowledge of the situation,' which, appellant now contends, resulted in liability on the part of respondents for her husband’s death.\nIt must be held, as a matter of law, that the record before us discloses no evidence that Mr. Conradi’s fall was due to any negligent act or omission on the part of respondents, and the judgment appealed from is, accordingly, affirmed.\nJeffers, Steinert, Mallery, and Hill, JJ., concur."""
8848167,"Wilkening v. Watkins Distributors, Inc.","""[As amended by order of the Court of Appeals October 19, 1989.]\nMunson, J.\nWatkins Distributors, Inc., et al, appeal a judgment awarding damages against them, as lessees and assignees, for the cost of replacing a hot tar roof of a leased warehouse and assessing attorney fees and costs. We affirm.\nOn June 11, 1975, Rake's Mountain Distributors, Inc. (Watkins) entered into a 5-year lease of a warehouse with the Olive Wilkening family (Wilkening). At that time, the east end of the building was being completed, and there were some interior alterations being made in the center section. That lease provided that the lessor would be responsible for structural defects during the first year and corrections would be made at lessor's expense. Thereafter, the lessor would have no responsibility for any defects \""which may show up in the rental unit.\"" Attached thereto was schedule B which indicated the repairs, improvements, and alterations to the premises required of Wilkening as a condition of the lease. Roofing was included in the list; testimony revealed schedule B referred to completion of the building's new construction including roofing.\nApproximately 2 years later, the parties began negotiations for a new lease covering the same premises. On January 1, 1978, they executed a second lease, for a 150-month term, commencing January 1, 1978, and ending July 31, 1990. Rental rates were based upon a graduated scale with the highest payments being $5,490 per month from July 1985 to June 1990. The use again was specified as a wholesale beverage distributorship unless a change of purpose was consented to by the landlord. This lease contained a general maintenance clause which placed the responsibility of maintaining and repairing the premises on the tenant and eliminated the language dealing with structural defects. Likewise, the leased premises were to be returned to the landlord in as good a condition as at the time of possession, subject to reasonable wear and tear. This lease was personally guaranteed by George Watkins and Gaston Oullet.\nOn September 1, 1981, Watkins sold its business to B&B Distributors, Inc., which assumed the subject lease and took possession of the premises. The 1978 lease stated it could not be assigned without Wilkening's written consent; no consent was given by Wilkening. Thus, the assignment did not release Watkins from its primary responsibility for performance. OTR v. Flakey Jake's, Inc., 112 Wn.2d 243, 248, 770 P.2d 629 (1989). On March 1, 1983, B&B assigned its leasehold interest to Floor Supply Distributing, Inc., again without obtaining Wilkening's written consent. Nonetheless, as with B&B, Wilkening accepted the rent payments without objection.\nIn 1983 following significant water leakage, Floor Supply had the warehouse roof examined by a roofing contractor. This inspection revealed the roof's deteriorated condition and the need for an entire reroofing. The west end was in the worst condition.\nOn August 24, 1983, Wilkening's attorney sent Watkins a letter advising the roof on the west end was in need of immediate repair and maintenance; that Watkins was responsible pursuant to the lease to repair it; and absent action by Watkins, the roof would be repaired at Wilken-ing's direction and repayment sought. Watkins disagreed. Thereafter Wilkening had the west portion of the roof replaced at a cost of $8,828.82, and with a cover letter, sent the work invoice to Watkins seeking reimbursement. Watkins declined payment.\nThe rest of the roof continued to leak causing damage to Floor Supply's inventory. On October 9, 1985, Wilkening's attorney sent a similar letter to Watkins indicating the need to reroof the remaining portions. A bid was acquired and forwarded to Watkins. Upon receiving no response, Wilkening had the work performed in August 1986. The total cost was $22,353.89. Once again, Wilkening's request for reimbursement was declined by Watkins based on a denial of liability.\nWilkening brought this action seeking reimbursement for the entire cost of the reroofing. There is evidence that a tar roof requires a maintenance coat of tar, usually applied with a mop, every 3 to 5 years. The original tar roof was guaranteed by the roofing contractor for 10 years provided this maintenance program is followed. While there is factual dispute as to the average age of a tar roof, the court found that the roof lasted beyond its life expectancy. The court further found it was the intent of the parties that this roof would \""endure the leasehold period,\"" i.e., 15 years. The court concluded Watkins breached the general maintenance clause of the lease by failing to maintain the roof. Damages were imposed for the costs of roof replacement along with attorney fees and costs.\nThe primary issue is whether the lease's general maintenance provision imposes a duty upon Watkins as lessee to apply periodic hot tar treatments to the roof of the leased building.\nIn interpreting a lease, we examine the document itself and \""determine the mutual intentions of the contracting parties according to the reasonable meaning of their words and acts.\"" Fisher Properties, Inc. v. Arden-Mayfair, Inc., 106 Wn.2d 826, 837, 726 P.2d 8 (1986). \""[W]hat controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used.\"" Washington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, 96 Wn.2d 322, 328, 635 P.2d 138 (1981) (citing Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897)). \""Leases are contracts, as well as conveyances, and as such the rules of construction that apply to contracts also apply to leases.\"" Seattle-First Nat'l Bank v. Westlake Park Assocs., 42 Wn. App. 269, 272, 711 P.2d 361 (1985), review denied, 105 Wn.2d 1015 (1986).\nThe 1978 lease, paragraph 7, provides in pertinent part:\nMAINTENANCE\n[T]he tenant shall have sole responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the rental unit covered by this lease. The tenant at its expense shall maintain the rental unit in every respect, in a state of good repair and in good condition throughout the term of this lease.\n(Italics ours.) (The paragraph continues as to the tenant's duty to maintain sidewalks and access ways free of ice and snow, keep all drainage pipes open, the building properly heated, and replace any broken glass.)\nParagraph 8 states in part:\nTenant shall assume, exclusively, full risk for damage to the rental unit including but not restricted to the building and fixtures which may result from fire, from the elements and from any other cause.\n(Italics ours.) (The lease then speaks of the tenant's responsibility to maintain fire insurance.)\nParagraph 11 states in part:\nUpon termination of the lease the premises shall be returned to the possession of Landlords in condition as good as they are at the time possession thereof is taken by Tenant, subject, however, to reasonable wear and tear which will have taken place through normal use by Tenant.\nThere is no provision designating either party's responsibility for the roof, as was found in Puget Inv. Co. v. Wenck, 36 Wn.2d 817, 221 P.2d 459, 20 A.L.R.2d 1320 (1950) and McManamon v. Tobiason, 75 Wash. 46, 134 P. 524 (1913). Nor is there anything in the record to indicate the issue of maintaining the roof was discussed by the original parties to the lease or that Watkins and its assignees were aware, at the inception of the lease or assignment, that a tar roof required a mop maintenance every 3 to 5 years. Watkins defended on the theory that a roof was a structural part of the building, which might from time to time require major and permanent repairs, and thus not the tenant's responsibility.\nWashington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, supra, held in part that a general obligation to maintain the premises and upon expiration of the lease surrender it in as good condition as when the lessee took possession, except for ordinary wear and tear, did not require lessee to rebuild the premises when it was destroyed by fire. Thus, the court overruled the common law as enunciated in Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897) and its progeny. However, as noted earlier, the court stated: \""As we said in Armstrong, what controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used. ... We will not extend the obligation of lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used ...\"" Payne, at 328.\nAs noted previously, this lease provides the tenant has \""the sole responsibility for maintenance and repair\"" of the unit, at its expense, in every respect; further, that the tenant \""assume[s], exclusively, full risk for damage\"" to the unit, be it from fire, from the elements, or from any other cause. At the conclusion of paragraph 8, from which the preceding text was taken and after discussion of insurance coverage, the lease provides: \""Landlords shall have no responsibility whatsoever.\"" This combination of language imposes a heavy responsibility upon the tenant; the trial court so found in holding the tenant responsible for maintenance in order to permit the roof to endure during the leasehold period. The court's findings are supported by substantial evidence.\nWe find Watkins' analogy to Payne, while not requiring rebuilding of a destroyed structure, is not applicable when replacement of a roof covering is a result of the tenant's failure to perform proper maintenance as required by the terms of the lease.\nThe lease provides for attorney fees.\nThe judgment is affirmed and the case remanded for determination of reasonable attorney fees on appeal.\nThompson, C.J., and Green, J., concur.\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied October 19, 1989.\nReview denied at 114 Wn.2d 1003 (1990).\nRake's Mountain Distributors subsequently changed its name to Watkins Distributors.\nThe warehouse building is 105 feet in width and approximately 507 feet in length. It is divided by two parapets which separate the roof into three sections. The first, the west end, was constructed in 1968, consisted of 13,000 square feet, was recoated in 1975 per the terms of the original lease and was reroofed in 1984. The second, the center section, was constructed in 1973, consisted of 24,000 square feet, and was reroofed in August 1986. The third section, the east end, was constructed in 1974, consisted of 13,000 square feet, and was reroofed in August 1986. It was to be used only as a wholesale beverage distributorship unless consent of the lessor was given.\nWhile examination of the lease language as a whole provides for such a result, a specific provision dealing with hot tar treatment, including time frames, and allocation of responsibility for the same would avoid such problems in the future."""
1086651,"Bach v. Sarich","""Williams, J.\nThis appeal arises out of a suit to enjoin further construction of an apartment building which would extend out over the surface of Bitter Lake in Seattle, and to compel removal of the existing structure.\nBitter Lake is a nonnavigable, natural body of water about 19 acres in area, situated in the north section of the city of Seattle. It is unmeandered, which means that in the original federal government survey the surveyors did not locate the shoreline, but merely ran the government section lines across the lake. As a result many shoreline property owners also own subdivided portions of the lake bed. The lake is surrounded principally by single residences, together with a few multiple residences, a public school ground, and a small city park. Residents of the area have long used the entire lake surface for recreational activities.\nThe plaintiffs are 24 property owners who own upland abutting the lake and, in some instances, parts of the lake bed, or who otherwise have access rights to the lake by reason of an easement to the lake shore. Defendants own a parcel of land abutting on the east side of the lake at the south end, about two-thirds of which is upland and one-third lake bed. Title is traced to an 1872 federal government patent, which made no reference to the lake.\nThe south end of the lake, including defendants’ property, has been business zoned for many years, and was formerly operated as Playland Amusement Park. The property is currently zoned commercial general (CG) by the city of Seattle. In zoning the land around the lake the city ran its zoning lines across the lake surface so that the entire lake bed is zoned. Defendants’ submerged land is zoned commercial general, while other portions of the lake bed are zoned residential.\nIn August, 1966 defendants purchased the property in question, after having procured preliminary architectural plans for the construction of four apartment buildings. Apartment buildings Nos. 1 and 2 were to be constructed partly on the upland, but would extend approximately 130 feet out into the lake, supported on two finger-like piers secured by cement pilings. Apartments Nos. 3 and 4 were to be constructed entirely on the upland abutting the lake. Mortgage commitments were obtained based on these plans, and on June 12, 1967, a building permit was issued by the city of Seattle.\nOn June 5, 1967, excavation of the upland was commenced and on June 8 or 9 dirt was first pushed into the lake about 25 feet in order to form a base or pad. Some of the plaintiffs immediately protested to defendants and began making an investigation to determine the extent of defendants’ construction plans. The protests went unheeded so plaintiffs on July 5, 1967, brought an action to enjoin defendants from filling or building over the surface of the lake. In conjunction with that action they posted a $1,000 bond and obtained an exparte temporary order restraining the defendants from interfering with the surface area and shoreline of Bitter Lake.\nThe motion for a temporary injunction was heard on July 15, 1967, by a different department of the superior court than that which later heard the case on the merits. The court denied the motion but delayed the effective date of the order so that plaintiffs might petition this court for a writ of review. On July 20, 1967, that petition was denied by this court on procedural grounds. It was understood at the time that the ruling did not reach the merits of the petition.\nOn July 21, 1967, the temporary restraining order was dissolved. Plaintiffs then made every effort to get the case to trial and in fact secured a substantially earlier trial date than would have been possible through the normal progression of the trial docket in King County. Trial was commenced on October. 10, 1967.\nPending the trial on the merits, defendants proceeded as rapidly as possible with the construction of apartment No. 1 and the concrete slab to support it. The slab projects out into the lake approximately 130 feet and is 77 feet wide. Beneath it the lake is filled with dirt, and pilings of steel beams are used to support it. The slab will be 1.18 feet above high water and 6.18 feet above low water. The apartment constructed on the slab will be three stories in height. At the time of trial it was planned that both apartments Nos. 1 and 2 would extend out over the water. However, in oral argument in this court defendants stated that the plans for apartment No. 2 had been modified so that it would be constructed entirely on upland.\nThe trial court determined that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, and enjoined them from further construction over the surface of the lake. In addition, defendants were ordered to remove the existing structure and earth fill, which had been put there during the period prior to the trial.\nDefendants’ 12 assignments of error are directed to (1) the trial court’s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, (2) the remedy granted in view of hardship caused to defendants relative to hardship plaintiffs would suffer if the mandatory injunction were denied, (3) prejudice of the trial judge in view of his personal experience as attorney in a prior case which dealt with surface rights of lake shore owners, (4) the trial court’s findings that defendants disregarded protests of plaintiffs and the pendency of this suit, and its failure to include a specific finding on defendants’ good faith, and (5) the trial court’s failure to find adverse possession of the area in question by defendants’ predecessor in title.\nIn the challenge to the trial court’s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, defendants emphasize the effect of the commercial zoning imposed on their property. Defendants contend that their apartment is a riparian use, and that reasonableness is the test for its permissibility. They further contend that reasonableness in this case is a legislative determination expressed in the city zoning ordinance. In other words, the Seattle City Council, by conferring a commercial general zoning classification on this property, and issuing a building permit, determined that an apartment is a reasonable and proper use of this tract, which includes lake bed property.\nRiparian rights and privileges are conferred upon a property owner by virtue of the contiguity of his property to a body of water. Mayer v. Grueber, 29 Wis. 2d 168, 138 N.W.2d 197 (1965). Although we have never promulgated an all-inclusive definition of riparian rights, we have previously recognized as riparian rights on nonnavigable lakes the rights of swimming, fishing, boating, and bathing. Snively v. Jaber, 48 Wn.2d 815, 296 P.2d 1015, 57 A.L.R.2d 560 (1956). Further, these rights have been characterized as vested property interests, included in the protection afforded by Const, art. 1 § 16, which provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., 36 Wn.2d 284, 218 P.2d 309 (1950).\nWe cannot agree that defendants’ apartment constructed over water constitutes a riparian use, or that its permissibility comes within a rule of reasonableness as determined by the Seattle zoning authorities.\nMere proximity of the apartment to the water does not render it a riparian use. With respect to a structure, such a use must be so intimately associated with the water that apart from the water its utility would be seriously impaired. This is not the case with defendants’ prospective use. The utility of the apartment is in no way dependent upon the waters of Bitter Lake, and its utility as an apartment would be in no way impaired apart from this lake. This is evidenced by the fact that apartments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are entirely on upland property.\nNor may defendants justify the presence of their apartment by the commercial zoning classification imposed by the city of Seattle or by the issuance of a building permit.\nAll riparian owners along the shore of a natural, nonnavigable lake share in common the right to use the entire surface of the lake for boating, swimming, fishing, and other similar riparian rights so long as there is no unreasonable interference with the exercise of these rights by other respective owners. Snively v. Jaber, supra; Botton v. State, 69 Wn.2d 751, 420 P.2d 352 (1966) , These rights are vested property rights, and may not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., supra. It follows, therefore, that while the city of Seattle might regulate the exercise of these rights by means of its police power, it may not totally divest plaintiffs of them through the mechanisms of zoning. Indeed, the effect of this case, if we were to follow defendants’ reasoning, would be to divest plaintiffs of valuable property rights for the private use and benefit of defendants. Such a result is clearly contrary to the law, and we are certain was not intended by the Seattle zoning authorities when the commercial general classification was placed on defendants’ property.\nDefendants next assert error in the trial court’s choice of remedy, in that defendants were required to remove the structure it placed out over the surface of the lake. It must be noted, in response to this assertion, that since we have determined that defendants’ apartment does not constitute a riparian use, it becomes in effect an encroachment upon plaintiffs’ common rights to use this portion of the lake surface for purposes of riparian enjoyment. In view of this, it is defendants’ contention that nonetheless, an application of the doctrine of relative hardship, or balancing the equities, requires that they not be enjoined to remove the existing structure now in place. Although it is not clear from the evidence, the amount of loss might be substantial that defendants could suffer if unable to complete apartment No. 1. Estimates by the plaintiffs based on defendants’ figures fix the maximum possible loss at approximately $100,000. Defendants on the other hand contend they will lose in excess of $250,000. The evidence indicates, however, that when it became apparent that defendants faced a lawsuit to halt construction of apartment No. 1 with the ever existing possibility that they might lose, they took no action to mitigate their potential loss by attempting to renegotiate or cancel the construction contracts or other financial commitments. At that time only a small proportion of the total financial commitment had actually been expended and the remaining potential loss depended on the binding effect of the commitments, most of which were oral in nature, the rigidity of the other contracting parties position, and the feasibility of altering construction plans.\nFrom the very commencement of defendants’ construction they were aware of the protests of other riparian owners. The encroaching structure did not exist at the time of suit, but was built during the pendency of this suit. Defendant contractor, Mr. Ray Lotto, testified that after the temporary restraining order was dissolved “we proceeded as fast as we could, because, at that time, we already lost two weeks.”\nThus, defendants proceeded to construct the apartment in question with full knowledge that their right to do so was contested and that there was a real likelihood, in view of our holding in Snively v. Jaber, supra, that the case on the merits would be decided against them. In addition, the court in its oral opinion dissolving the temporary restraining order, pointed out that the case was going to be appealed, would be a landmark case, and the Supreme Court might look at it differently. During oral arguments defendants’ counsel admitted that they knowingly took a risk by continuing construction while the case was pending on the merits, and indeed, there is no other possible interpretation of defendants’ conduct. Their explanation was that although not much construction had been done on apartment No. 1 they were already financially committed to the entire project and felt they had to take the risk.\nThe benefit of the doctrine of balancing the equities, or relative hardship, is reserved for the innocent defendant who proceeds without knowledge or warning that his structure encroaches upon another’s property or property rights. City of Dunsmuir v. Silva, 154 Cal. App. 2d 825, 317 P.2d 653 (1957); Winthers v. Bertrand, 239 Ore. 97, 396 P.2d 570 (1964). Under the circumstances of this case, defendants are not entitled to evoke the benefit of this doctrine.\nDefendants next assert that the bias of the trial judge prevented them from having a fair trial. This assignment is based on the prior experience of the trial judge as counsel for Dr. J. Howard Snively, who was subsequently a party in Snively v. Jaber, supra. Although the trial judge did not represent Dr. Snively in that suit, he did offer legal advice to him. Defendants argue that that experience prejudiced the judge’s views on the issue of defendants’ good faith and caused him to prejudge the case even before the trial started.\nRCW 4.12.040 provides in part:\nNo judge of a superior court of the state of Washington shall sit to hear or try any action or proceeding when it shall be established as hereinafter provided that said judge is prejudiced against any party or attorney, or the interest of any party or attorney appearing in such cause.\nClearly, defendants show no prejudice which comes within the requirements of this statute. Merely because a judge has had occasion to study a point of law and offer advice based on his interpretation of it is no grounds for disqualification. This assignment is without merit. '\nDefendants charge error in the trial court’s refusal to find that defendants’ predecessor in interest, Playland Amusement Park, established the exclusive right to use the disputed portion of the lake by adverse possession. We find no merit to this contention in light of testimony of a former park policeman that his intentions were only to prevent persons from entering the park without paying the entrance fee. There was no evidence that other riparian owners were ever prevented from using the entire surface of the lake, or that the operators of Playland Amusement Park ever intended to assert any proprietary rights over portions of the surface abutting its shore. Indeed, certain residents of Bitter Lake testified that they had always used the entire surface of the lake, including portions over the area owned by defendants, even while Playland was in operation. In any event, it was a disputed question of fact and as there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial court, it will not be disturbed on appeal. State ex rel. Carroll v. Seattle Hotel Bldg. Corp., 41 Wn.2d 595, 250 P.2d 982 (1952).\nDefendants next assign error to the trial court’s refusal to grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The evidence was the testimony of a daughter of defendants’ predecessor in interest and related to the question of adverse use of that portion of the lake in dispute. The substance of her testimony was before the trial judge by way of affidavit in support of the motion. It was to some extent cumulative in nature, and we do not feel that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.\nDefendants finally argue that under Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 19 L. Ed. 530, 88 Sup. Ct. 438 (1967), the federal common law controls the result here; and that under the federal common law the defendants have a right to build their apartment on a fill on their portion of the lake bed.\nThis contention is based on the fact that defendants’ title is to upland property and submerged land, and is traced to an 1872 federal government patent. This patent was issued prior to Washington statehood, and made no reference to the lake.\nIn Hughes, supra, the issue presented was whether federal or state laws governs the ownership of accreted land, gradually deposited by the ocean on adjoining upland property conveyed by the United States to petitioner’s predecessor in title prior to Washington statehood. The United States Supreme Court held that federal law applied, and that under federal law petitioner was entitled to the accretion that had gradually formed along her ocean-front property.\nThe Hughes decision is in no way applicable to the instant case. We are not concerned here with the ownership of land or the extent or validity of title created by a federal act. As stated by Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in Hughes, 389 U.S. at 295:\nSurely it must be conceded as a general proposition that the law of real property is, under our Constitution, left to the individual States to develop and administer. And surely Washington or any other State is free to make changes, either legislative or judicial, in its general rules of real property law, including the rules governing the property rights of riparian owners. Nor are riparian owners who derive their title from the United States somehow immune from the changing impact of these general state rules. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342. For if they were, then the property law of a State like Washington, carved entirely out of federal territory, would be forever frozen into the mold it occupied on the date of the State’s admission to the Union.\nWe must, therefore, conclude that there was no error in the trial court’s determination of the property rights of the riparian owners on Bitter Lake, nor in the remedy afforded in the form of a mandatory injunction.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nFinley, C. J., Weaver, Hunter, and McGovern, JJ., concur.\nJanuary 24,1969. Petition for rehearing denied.\nJudge Williams is serving as a judge pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Art. 4, § 2(a) (amendment 38), state constitution..\nOther jurisdictions which have adopted this same rule are represented by the following cases: Harris v. Brooks, 225 Ark. 436, 283 S.W.2d 129 (1955); Burt v. Munger, 314 Mich. 659, 23 N.W.2d 117 (1946); Flynn v. Beisel, 257 Minn. 531, 102 N.W.2d 284 (1960); State Game & Fish Comm’n v. Louis Fritz Co., 187 Miss. 539, 193 So. 9 (1940); Duval v. Thomas, 114 So.2d 791 (Fla. 1959); and Improved Realty Corp. v. Sowers, 195 Va. 317, 78 S.E.2d 588 (1953)."""
