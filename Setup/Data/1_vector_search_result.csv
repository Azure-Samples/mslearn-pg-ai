615468,"Le Vette v. Hardman Estate","""Morris, J.\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\n“That the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor’s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.”\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, § 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant’s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be’held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\nCrow, C. J., Parker, Fullerton, and Mount, JJ., concur."""
768356,"Uhl Bros. v. Hull","""Holcomb, J.\nAppellant, subtenant of a former lessee of a former owner of certain premises in Seattle, sued respondents, subsequent purchasers from the former owner of the property, for damages alleged to have been caused by water issuing from unprotected pipes upon portions of the premises over which respondents had exclusive control and appellant had none, claiming the total sum of $3,295.26.\nUpon issue being joined and the case tried, the court made findings of fact which explain the nature of the case as briefly as can be done. The findings are as follows:\n“I. On July 17, 1919, one George G. Gross was the owner of the building referred to in the complaint. It consisted of a basement, five storerooms fronting on Union Street, numbered from the corner store, which was No. 500 Union Street, easterly to the alley in the block, the other street numbers being 504, 506, 508 and 510, and a hotel on the floors above. On that date the owner leased to Converse Co. Inc., a corporation, the storeroom numbered 510 and all of the basement of the building, except a furnace room situate on the northeast corner of the basement. On April .30, 1921, the Converse Co. Inc., sublet to the plaintiff the northerly portion of such basement, and the possession under said lease and sub-lease continued in the lessee and sub-tenant respectively until after May 22, 1922.\n“II. On or about March 1, 1921, said store-room No. 506 was under lease from said Gross for a term then unexpired, and on the date last named the lessee thereof assigned his lease to one Stockhoff, who took possession of the leased premises and remained there in possession until on or about June 30,1921.\n“III. At the time Stockhoff moved in there was no water connection in or to said store-room No. 506. He installed a water supply in said store-room. This supply was by means of two half-inch pipes running between the floor of No. 506 and the ceiling of the basement shortly thereafter occupied by the plaintiff. One of these pipes was connected with the cold water system by tapping the pipe which supplied cold water to a sink or basin theretofore and now located toward the rear or western end of a hall-way which extended along the rear of said store-room No. 504, 506, 508 and 510. The flow of water at the point of connection was controlled by a cut-off then separately installed for that purpose. That hall-way was used in common by the tenants of said store-rooms numbered 506, 508 and 510, and by the basement tenants other than the tenant of the furnace room. Said cold water pipe extended from under said sink down beneath the floor of the hall-way and thence through an opening in the partition and into said space between said floor and ceiling for a distance of 20 feet or thereabouts. It then had an elbow deflecting it up to and through the floor of No. 506. The hot water pipe paralleled the course of the cold water pipe in said space between ceiling and floor, and turned by an elbow at the same point and passed up through the floor into said storeroom. The method of this installation was not known to said Gross or his agents. On or about August 1, 1921, the said Gross leased No. 506 to one O’Brien, who thereupon moved in and remained there until about May 1, 1922. From thence until after May 22, 1922, said store-room No. 506 remained vacant. All of that water connection which extended above the floor was taken out by Stoekkoff when he moved out. Shortly after O ’Brien moved in all that was visible of the same was the two holes in the floor referred to, and a hole for the waste pipe and each of the two first-named contained a cap such as is used in plumbing for capping a half-inch pipe. In December, 1921, the defendants bought said building from said Gross and conveyance being made accordingly. At that time and thereafter until May 22, 1922, the condition last above described as existing in said room No. 506 continued without change.\n“IV. On the night of May 20, and during May 21st and the early hours of May 22, 1922, the stock of wall paper of the plaintiff stored in said portion of basement occupied by the plaintiff became damaged by water escaping on to it from the ceiling above. A plumber employed in the emergency crawled with difficulty into the opening above referred to and, dragging his body along the said two pipes to the end of the same, discovered the cause was that said cold water pipe was open at its extremity. Some person unknown maliciously or otherwise disposed (not the plaintiff nor either of the defendants nor any employee or agent of them or either of them nor the tenant of No. 508) had turned the cutoff under the sink aforesaid so that the water flowed out through that pipe over onto the basement ceiling and through it upon said stock of goods. At that time the caps aforesaid, screwed on to nipples, remained in the floor above, extending down through the floor, but there was a gap between the top of the elbow and the bottom of the nipple of about one foot. How this condition came about, the evidence does not disclose. A preponderance of the evidence is that it existed from the time Stockhoff moved out.\n“V. Neither the said Gross nor the defendants nor the plaintiff nor any agent of either ever knew of the existence of that condition until after it was repaired on the morning of May 22,1922, and in the exercise of ordinary prudence none of them could have discovered it. The existence and location of the caps in the floor visible from above indicated that the water supply had been properly protected by caps so that water could not escape from the supply pipes and any person viewing the same would have been justified in so concluding. The space between the floor and ceiling above referred to was in total darkness so that the condition at the end of the pipes was only discoverable in the manner in which it was discovered as aforesaid and then only by carrying artificial light into the place. The cut-off under the sink was of the ordinary type, but was not visible to one observing the sink except by the intrusion below the sink of artificial light. Access to said sink was open during business hours. The entrance to said hallway from outside the building was controlled by said Converse Co., and whenever that company closed its establishment said door was locked. It was so locked at about five P. M. of May 20th.\n“VI. The water was flowing at eight o’clock on said Saturday night, but the evidence does not show when the flow began, the preponderance being that the flow commenced between five and eight o ’clock of that day. During that period of time the access to the sink was possible only to the occupants or visitors to said store-rooms numbered 508 and 510. The fact that water was escaping was not discovered until eight o’clock on said Monday morning.”\nUpon these findings the court concluded that appellant had no right of recovery.\nAppellant excepted to certain findings made by the court and to the refusal of the court to make findings requested by it. The errors claimed are:\n1. In finding that the condition of the water connections and the pipe ends in the floor of No. 506 gave no notice of the dangerous defect.\n2. In finding that the defendants and their agents knew nothing of the condition of the pipes until after the accident.\n3. In refusing to find it to be the duty of the defendants to have made careful examination of the plumbing and water pipes, especially those indicated by the holes in the floor of No. 506; and in refusing to find that the defendants were guilty of negligence in not so doing.\n4. In entering judgment in favor of defendants; and that the findings do not sustain the judgment.\n5. In overruling the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.\nThere is no error in either of the findings first assailed, for the evidence sustains them. In fact, as to the1 first claim there is no contradiction in the evidence; and as to the second claimed error, the only claim is that of imputed notice to the former owner and his agent, which cannot be imputed to the later one, who had no actual notice.\nThe principal point of contention is upon the third assignment.\nUnder this claim appellant contends that the owner of the premises is an insurer of his tenant in one part of the premises for damages flowing from a defect in another part of the premises which other part is under the control of the owner and not under the control of the tenant. Cases from other jurisdictions are cited and it is insisted that the case of Le Vette v. Hardman Estate, 77 Wash. 320, 137 Pac. 454, L. R. A. 1917B 222, sustains that contention.\nAppellant is in error. By reference to the Le Vette case, it will he found that the basis of the complaint was negligence. There was some evidence to show negligence on the part of the landlord, but the trial court dismissed the action by the tenant on granting the nonsuit. This court held that the failure to exercise proper superintendence over the upper story of the building in question might be held to be negligence, and that at least it was a question that should have been submitted to the jury.\nThat is not the case here. In this case the trial judge heard the witnesses and resolved the evidence against the allegations of negligence upon competent and credible evidence. He also found that respondents had no notice of the defect, and that the defects in the plumbing could not be discovered by ordinary care and prudence. He viewed the premises himself and was able to judge of the conditions accurately.\nWe have never held that a landlord is an insurer of the premises of the tenant, but in fact have held to the contrary, as in the LeVette case, supra, that the landlord is bound to ordinary care only, and liable only for negligence for lack of such care. Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873.\nAnd a sub-tenant has no greater rights against the owner than has his immediate landlord, the sub-lessor. Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 917; Hogan v. Metropolitan Building Co., 120 Wash. 82, 206 Pac. 959.\nThe judgment is right and it is affirmed.\nMain, C.

674990,"Woolworth Co. v. City of Seattle","""Mitchell, J.\nAppellant, plaintiff below, was engaged in the mercantile business in the Arcade Building, in Seattle. In addition to its salesroom, it occupied the basement underneath for the storage, receiving, checking and shipping of its merchandise. It was a tenant of the premises, the basement of which abuts upon University street. The city maintained a sewer in University street. Radiating from this sewer there was a lateral sewer from and accommodating the premises used by appellant. On March 5, 1917, there was an average heavy rainfall, when the basement became flooded, causing damage to appellant’s goods and merchandise which, together with the cost of removing and cleaning the same, amounted to the alleged sum of $448.56. Charging the city with negligence in maintaining a main sewer on University street inadequate to meet the burden imposed upon it, resulting in the damage referred to, appellant presented to the city its duly verified claim for damages, the rejection of which occasioned this action. The city, by its answer, denied liability, and affirmatively answered, alleging contributory negligence. The case was tried without a jury. At the close of plaintiff’s case, the court granted defendant’s motion for a non-suit. Upon the request of defendant, findings of fact were made, upon which a judgment of dismissal was entered. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.\nOn the date mentioned, and for some years prior thereto, there was in force an ordinance of the city which, inter alia, provides:\n“All cellar and basement drains must, when connected to sewer, ... be protected from backwater by backwater valves; said backwater valves must be provided with an air-tight clean-out cover placed immediately above valve, either screwed or bolted in place, capable of being removed for examination or repairs.” Ordinance No. 22,839, § 32.\nIn the basement there was installed an iron manhole or receiving water tank, some two feet deep and about the same in diameter, narrower at the top, on which was placed, flush with the floor, a latticed circular iron cover having a mesh about two inches square. Within the manhole the intake of the drain pipe formed an elbow, the end of which, turned down and submerged in water when in place, was below the bottom of the stem of the drain pipe, thus forming a trap to prevent odors escaping from the sewer. On the stem of the pipe near the elbow and within the manhole there was constructed a backwater valve and cover as provided by the ordinance of the city. The drain pipe ran into a larger one from the building and thence into the University street main sewer. The water that flooded the basement poured back boiling out of the manhole.\nIt is the contention of appellant that the incapacity of the main sewer alone caused the flooding, while the respondent claims the backwater valve had been allowed to become unclean and clogged by the fault-of appellant, thus causing the flooding and damage. The trial court found the main sewer inadequate, to which the city took no exception, and also found the appellant negligent in not keeping the backwater valve clean and in proper repair, to which appellant excepted. There is no testimony to show the backwater valve was structurally insufficient or out of repair.\nThere was ample testimony by the head janitor, superintendent, and assistant superintendent of the building, and by E. M. Barstow, manager of appellant’s mercantile business in Seattle, all of whom witnessed the flooding, to justify the finding that all the water which caused the damage backed up from the street sewer through the drain pipe and manhole into the basement.\nOn the other hand, O. A. Davis, appellant’s witness, a plumber and member of the firm that put in the plumbing, testified in detail as to its construction and operation, using a backwater valve to illustrate and explain its proper purpose and functions. It appears the backwater valve consisted of a solid door which hung vertically inside the drain pipe from a hinge, and when undisturbed rested against the surface of a circular collar or shoulder. Water escaping from the basement through the manhole and drain pipe would have no trouble in causing the door of the backwater valve to yield, while wafer backing up the drain pipe would force the door of the backwater valve against the shoulder and thus prevent the further passage of water, assuming always there is no debris or trash to clog the proper operation of the door of the backwater valve. The plumber stated that, if the door to the valve were free, backwater from the sewer could not pass — the harder the pressure from that direction all the better, if possible, to prevent the backwater from passing. Appellant attempted to meet the force of this testimony by showing the basement floor was cleaned at-the end of each day’s work; but considering the manner in which the backwater valve was constructed, and the further fact that there was no fine screen over either the manhole or the intake of the drain pipe, nor other device to prevent debris from getting into the valve, the flooding backward from the sewer is explainable on no reasonable theory other than that the door to the valve had been rendered useless by reason of carelessness in permitting waste matter to get into and clog the door of the backwater .valve.\nCounsel for appellant also contends that a part of the flood water or sewage came back into the basement through the toilet. We do not so understand the proof. The rear of the basement was fifteen inches higher than that where the flood occurred. The toilet was situated in the rear basement, but all the witnesses who testified on this point said the damage was done by water pouring back through the manhole in the lower basement. The evidence does not show how the plumbing was constructed from the toilet into the sewer. One witness only, E. C. Barstow, testified there was backwater through the toilet, but the record shows that, later in the trial, when another witness was being examined with reference to this, Mr. Bar-stow, to clear np some apparent confusion, stated to the court: “Water came from the toilet but did no damage in the basement. This damage all came through the manhole.” Counsel for appellant argues that Mr. Barstow was not testifying when the statement was made. Appellant is bound by the statement, however, as an admission during trial, for Mr. Barstow was general manager for appellant in the conduct of the business which had suffered the loss, and was such manager and agent at the time of the trial.\nThe finding of negligence against the respondent is unchallenged. The evidence preponderates in support of the finding of contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. The two acts of negligence concurring and co-operating constituted the proximate cause or occasion of the damage complained of, thus precluding a recovery. Franklin v. Engel, 34 Wash. 480, 76 Pac. 84; 20 R. C. L., Negligence, §§ 88, 89.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMain, C. J., Mackintosh, and Tolman, JJ., concur."""
4938756,"Stevens v. King County","""Donworth, J.\nRespondents, as plaintiffs, brought this action against both the city of Seattle and Kang county to recover damages to real property caused by the invasion of surface waters. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs’ evidence, the trial court, sitting without a jury, sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence interposed by the county and dismissed the case as to that defendant. The trial then proceeded with the city as sole defendant, and at the conclusion thereof the trial court rendered an oral decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The city’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the oral decision having been denied, the court entered findings of fact and judgment for the plaintiffs against the city of Seattle, from which the latter has appealed.\nRespondents were represented in the trial court and in the perfecting of their appeal by counsel other than those who appeared for them at the time of the argument in this court.\nRespondents, husband and wife, are owners of a tract of land in King county, located a few blocks north of the city limits of Seattle at the northwest corner of North 102nd street and Aurora avenue. The property is bounded on the east by Aurora avenue, on the south by North 102nd street, and on the west by an alley which runs north and south parallel to Aurora avenue. About twenty feet north of respondents’ property, this alley is intersected by another alley running west to Linden avenue parallel to North 102nd street. Linden avenue, which runs northerly and southerly, is the next street to the west of Aurora avenue and intersects North 102nd street approximately one hundred yards west of respondents’ property. With the exception of Aurora avenue, which is a primary state..highway, all of these streets and alleys are unpaved county roads.\nRespondents’ land is improved by a store building located on the southern portion of the property, fronting on Aurora avenue, on the rear or west end of which two separate additions have been built which are used for living quarters and garage and storage purposes. The original store building has a concrete foundation wall, but the two additions rest on concrete blocks. Respondents became tenants of this property in 1942, purchased it in 1944 for five thousand dollars, and began to use the additions as their home on May 9,1946.\nIn order to understand the legal problems presented by this case, it is necessary to describe the topography of this area. North 102nd street is a graveled road which has been oiled and compacted. Immediately west of Aurora avenue, this street was graded by filling the traveled portion with gravel to an elevation somewhat higher than that of respondents’ property. For a distance of one hundred fifty feet west of Aurora avenue, the street surface is almost flat, having a very slight crown. The street then begins to rise in its westerly course so that, at its intersection with Linden avenue, its elevation is about twenty-five to thirty feet higher than its elevation adjacent to respondents’ property. West of Linden avenue, North 102nd street continues to rise for a considerable distance. The alley, abutting on respondents’ property on the west, slopes from north to south. The general slope of the ground and the natural drainage in this vicinity is from the northwest to the southeast in the direction of respondents’ property, which forms a sump or pothole.\nThe greater quantity of surface water arising on the hill to the west of respondents’ property travels south on Linden avenue to North 102nd street and east down that street to Aurora avenue. Some surface water flows east down the alley between North 102nd and North 103rd streets, turns into the alley to the west of respondents’ property, and runs south toward North 102nd. Except for Aurora avenue, there are no curbs, gutters, or sewers in this area for the purpose of carrying off the surface water.\nAccording to the testimony of respondent Sydney Stevens (who will be referred to as the respondent unless the context indicates otherwise), the surface wateri,had formed a small drainage ditch on the north side of North 102nd street to within one hundred feet of respondents’ property, where it then leveled out. Prior to January, 1948, according to his testimony, the surface water, with one exception, had always flowed past his property without entering thereon. The single exception was in 1945, when surface water settled in a puddle on North 102nd street near the front of the store building, but the water disappeared after the county deposited gravel in that spot. In respondents’ complaint, it was alleged that there had been repeated floodings of their premises since'May 9,1946, but at the trial respondent testified that this allegation was incorrect.\nOn January 20, 1948, the appellant, under a franchise from King county, commenced to lay water mains on North 102nd street connecting with an existing water main on Aurora avenue and running westward. This work was done by a contractor (to whom appellant had awarded this job) with the knowledge and under the supervision of the county engineer.\nA trench, approximately two feet wide and forty-four inches deep, was dug by appellant’s contractor ten feet north of, and parallel to, the center line of the street and twenty feet from the south edge of respondents’ property. The dirt was piled three or four feet high on the south side of the trench. The pipe was laid in eighteen-foot sections, and that portion of the trench was backfilled with earth and water on the same day. Two or three days later, the surface of the street was smoothed off with the blade of a “scoopmobile” (bulldozer with rubber tires). The surface dirt was removed by the contractor and dumped in a place remote from respondents’ property.\nThe alley to the west of respondents’ property was not disturbed in any manner, since no lateral pipes were laid. The job was completed in five days on January 24, 1948. Respondent testified that, after the appellant finished its installation, a barrier of dirt about one foot high was left, which remained several days, but the street was leveled before the rain came in February, 1948.\nThe evidence shows that the job was rather carefully inspected at every stage by both the appellant and King county to make certain that the street was left in the same condition that it was when the job was started. However, no measurements were taken to determine the precise level of the street either before or after the construction. Respondent testified that prior to the time appellant installed the water main the street was not in very good condition and had been neglected by the county. After flooding involved in this action, the county constructed a ditch on the north side of North 102nd street which has since conducted' surface water past respondents’ property to the sewer in Aurora avenue.\nDuring the actual laying of the water main, very little rain fell, but between the 13th and 18th of February, 1948, two and thirty-five hundredths inches of rain fell in this area.\nOn February 24, 1948, respondents filed their claim for damages with the appellant city of Seattle, as well as with the county. This claim not having been acted upon within sixty days from the filing thereof, this action was thereafter commenced. Paragraphs VII, VIII and IX of this claim stated as follows:\n“VII\n“On February 16, 1948, and prior and subsequent thereto, there was a substantial rainfall, and the surface waters and seepage flowing on said streets and alleys entered upon the claimants’ property in great volume.\n“VIII\n“As a result of the repeated flooding of claimants’ premises since May 9, 1946, the soil has been gradually washed away from under the foundation walls of claimants’ house and store building, causing the walls thereof to sag, causing distortions and displacements in the structure of said building. Many of the wooden timbers thereof which have been subjected to repeated water damage have become rotten, and a wooden stairway into the basement of the premises at 10207 Aurora has completely rotted out. The ground under the board walk leading from the sidewalk on North 102nd Street to claimants’ front door has been washed away, causing the walk to sink. The aforesaid flooding has also damaged claimants’ lawn and shrubbery.\n“IX\n“The aforesaid damage has been gradual and cumulative, increasing with the flooding of claimants’ property which has occurred after each rainfall.”\nThe contention of respondents is that the damage complained of was caused by appellant’s changing the street contours while making a public improvement which resulted in the surface water flowing down the street being diverted onto their property. They maintain that the judgment can be supported either upon the constitutional provision against damaging private property for a public use (Art. I, § 16) or upon the theory of appellant’s negligence. The trial court in its oral decision indicated that respondents’ recovery in this action was based on the city’s negligence.\nOn the other hand, appellant contends that there is absolutely no proof that surface water was collected by it and discharged upon respondents’ property in a concentrated form, and that there is no proof that the laying of the water main in North 102nd street resulted in any changing of the street contours so as to cause the flooding. Furthermore, it is argued that respondent did nothing to mitigate his damages, although he was aware of the flooding and could have protected his property at nominal expense.\nAppellant assigns as error the making of finding off fact No. VII, the failure to sustain appellant’s challenge to the sufficiency of respondents’ evidence, and the entry of judgment against the city for the sum of five hundred dollars.\nFinding No. VII reads as follows:\n“At the time defendant City performed such work on North 102nd Street, there was no substantial rainfall. Approximately in the middle of February, 1948, there was a heavy rainfall, with the result that large amounts of surface waters collected on the high ground west of plaintiffs’ property, and by virtue of the crown of North 102nd Street were prevented from flowing in their natural southeasterly course, but were conducted by open ditches on Linden Avenue and North 102nd Street to the intersection of said streets and thence east down North 102nd to the flat area immediately adjacent to plaintiffs’ property. By reason of the fact that defendant City had altered the contours of said street, the said surface waters thence flowed upon plaintiffs’ property in large volume, causing the foundations of their said buildings to settle, with resulting damage as hereinafter described. But for the construction work done by the defendant City as aforesaid, the said waters would have continued to flow in said street until reaching Aurora Avenue, whence they would have been conducted away by adequate drainage facilities, all without damage to plaintiff, as had been formerly the case.”\nWe have italicized the portion of this finding which is particularly to be .noted in connection with our discussion of the evidence in this case. Primarily, only questions of fact are here involved. North 102nd street, being outside of the city limits of Seattle, was entirely under the jurisdiction and control of King county. Therefore our decision in Kuhr v. Seattle, 15 Wn. (2d) 501, 131 P. (2d) 168 (cited by respondent), is not applicable.\nRespondent calls our attention to the well-established rule that findings of the trial court made upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed by this court unless we can say that such findings are clearly not supported by the weight of the evidence, citing Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 32 Wn. (2d) 256, 201 P. (2d) 207.\nFrom an examination of the entire record in this case, we are constrained to hold that the weight of the evidence does preponderate against the above-quoted finding. We will briefly state our reasons for so holding.\n1. Respondent’s claim against the city and county as well as the complaint (both were admitted in evidence) alleged that there had been repeated floodings of the premises since May, 1946, and that the damage had been gradual and cumulative. At the trial, he testified that these statements were erroneous, but his own witness Meroney, a former neighbor, testified in his deposition that there had been repeated floodings since 1946.\n2. This finding was made in spite of the trial court’s appraisal of respondent’s testimony as unsatisfactory. In its oral decision, the trial court commented upon respondent’s credibility as follows:\n“But I must concede to counsel that the re-reading of this plaintiff’s testimony does not convince me that I would be permitted to found my conclusions upon his sometimes rather disturbing testimony. He was quite an opinionated man and at times was almost flippant, not only towards his own counsel, but towards the Court and everybody else; and it was difficult to get from him just exactly what the facts were. He was bound to argue his case, and that made his own counsel’s problem somewhat difficult, as it did the rest of us.\n“But, apparently, he does not contend and does not claim to the Court that there was any dam left, a dam of loose earth left there at this point, ten feet north of the center of 102d Street at the time when the flood of -which he complains actually occurred.”\nSince respondent’s testimony was not considered by the trial court as adequate to support its findings, there was no credible testimony as to the essential facts to support the judgment other than that contained in the deposition of Mr. Meroney (whom the trial court did not see or hear testify). The court characterized Mr. Meroney’s testimony as “not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.” The latter’s testimony was outweighed by that produced by appellant.\n3. In opposition to these two witnesses, five witnesses were called by appellant, to wit, the King county district foreman, an engineer employed by the county engineer’s office, the city’s contractor who performed the work, the engineer in charge of the work for the city, and the district engineer for the city. All of them testified that the surface of North 102nd street in the vicinity of respondent’s property was in substantially the same condition after the water main was laid as before this work was done. Thus, the weight of the evidence is to the effect that the city did not change the contours of the street.\n4. In testifying in rebuttal, respondent admitted that the ridge of earth which he claimed appellant had left in the street after this work was completed was leveled off before the heavy rain came in February, 1948. Respondent’s only remaining cause of the flooding was that the city had changed the contours of the street. This is discussed in the preceding paragraph.\n5. The preponderance of the evidence does not support the above-quoted finding because respondent did not sustain the burden of proving that the laying of the water main by the city was the proximate cause of the flooding. Disregarding for the moment respondent’s allegations that there had been repeated flooding since 1946, his evidence merely showed that the flooding here involved occurred during the first heavy rain subsequent to the completion of the work, whereas no flooding took place just prior to doing the work at a time when there was also considerable rainfall.\nRespondent in his brief argues that the photographs taken by him, at the time the flooding occurred, show conclusively that most of the water which damaged his premises came from North 102nd street and not from the alley which forms the westerly boundary of his property. Four of these pictures have been enlarged, and we have given all of them careful consideration. The trial court’s comment regarding these pictures in its oral decision was as follows:\n“But this water, he [respondent] claims, came, in part, down the alley to the west of his property, and partly from the west. I think he suggested he thinks about five times the quantity from the west and probably one quarter from a point to the west, meeting up with one coming from this property.\n“Col. Nelson [appellant’s witness] seemed to think that more water had come down the west alley, east-and-west alley. I mean to a point west of the premises, and the area around east and west, probably than any other direction. But I do not think so, and I won’t stop to refer to it. I think one of the pho'tographs taken so indicates. You can almost see the heavy burden of water that came down’ along the north side of 102d Street.. The water in there, those pictures show the presence of water there, and convince me further of the actual presence of an unusual quantity of water; and that is confirmed as well by the testimony of both the plaintiff and his neighbor across the way. The neighbor’s testimony is not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\n“But the conclusive and elemental fact is that there was an excess of water which was not in accordance with the prior experience of the neighborhood within recent years, or at least that is the testimony. And he is also confronted with the fact that it should fall in exact coincidence with the preliminary construction of the water-pipe line and a rather heavy fall of rain, which followed in the succeeding month.”\nWhile the direction of the flow of the water is not as clearly discernible from the pictures as might be desired, nevertheless, if we assume respondent’s conclusion that the water nearly all flowed onto respondent’s property from North 102nd street to be correct, there would still not be sufficient evidence to support finding No. VII as to the cause of the flooding. The burden was upon respondent to prove that the city changed the contours of North 102nd street and that this change caused the flooding. The most favorable view of the evidence from respondent’s standpoint amounts to no more than a mere possibility that the flooding might have been caused in this manner. This is insufficient to support the trial court’s finding.\nIn Home Ins. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 18 Wn. (2d) 798, 140 P. (2d) 507, we had occasion to consider a rule of law which is applicable to the present case. We there said:\n“The rule is well established that the existence of a fact or facts cannot rest in guess, speculation, or conjecture. It is also the rule that the one having the affirmative of an issue does not have to make proof to an absolute certainty. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the thing in question, such as the occurrence of a fire, happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged therewith than it is that it happened in a way for which a person charged would not be liable. In applying the circumstantial evidence submitted to prove a fact, the trier of fact must recognize the distinction between that which is mere conjecture and what is a reasonable inference.”\nMore recently, in Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wn. (2d) 802, 180 P. (2d) 564, the same principle was stated briefly as follows:\n“We have frequently said that, if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred.”\nThis rule is equally applicable whether the trier of fact be a jury or a court sitting without a jury.\nSince w¿ find from the record that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court’s finding that the city changed the contour of North 102nd street in such a manner as to be the proximate cause of the flooding, the respondents are not entitled to any recovery as against the appellant upon either the theory of negligence or upon the theory of the city’s damaging of their property for a public use. To recover upon the latter theory, there must be a showing that the acts of appellant resulted in the damaging of respondents’ property for such purpose. The evidence applicable to this theory is insufficient to bring this case within the scope of our decision in Whiteside v. Benton County, 114 Wash. 463, 195 Pac. 519, and other similar cases cited by respondent.\nThe judgment is reversed, with directions to dismiss the action.\nSchwellenbach, Hill, Grady, and Hamley, JJ., concur."""
8848167,"Wilkening v. Watkins Distributors, Inc.","""[As amended by order of the Court of Appeals October 19, 1989.]\nMunson, J.\nWatkins Distributors, Inc., et al, appeal a judgment awarding damages against them, as lessees and assignees, for the cost of replacing a hot tar roof of a leased warehouse and assessing attorney fees and costs. We affirm.\nOn June 11, 1975, Rake's Mountain Distributors, Inc. (Watkins) entered into a 5-year lease of a warehouse with the Olive Wilkening family (Wilkening). At that time, the east end of the building was being completed, and there were some interior alterations being made in the center section. That lease provided that the lessor would be responsible for structural defects during the first year and corrections would be made at lessor's expense. Thereafter, the lessor would have no responsibility for any defects \""which may show up in the rental unit.\"" Attached thereto was schedule B which indicated the repairs, improvements, and alterations to the premises required of Wilkening as a condition of the lease. Roofing was included in the list; testimony revealed schedule B referred to completion of the building's new construction including roofing.\nApproximately 2 years later, the parties began negotiations for a new lease covering the same premises. On January 1, 1978, they executed a second lease, for a 150-month term, commencing January 1, 1978, and ending July 31, 1990. Rental rates were based upon a graduated scale with the highest payments being $5,490 per month from July 1985 to June 1990. The use again was specified as a wholesale beverage distributorship unless a change of purpose was consented to by the landlord. This lease contained a general maintenance clause which placed the responsibility of maintaining and repairing the premises on the tenant and eliminated the language dealing with structural defects. Likewise, the leased premises were to be returned to the landlord in as good a condition as at the time of possession, subject to reasonable wear and tear. This lease was personally guaranteed by George Watkins and Gaston Oullet.\nOn September 1, 1981, Watkins sold its business to B&B Distributors, Inc., which assumed the subject lease and took possession of the premises. The 1978 lease stated it could not be assigned without Wilkening's written consent; no consent was given by Wilkening. Thus, the assignment did not release Watkins from its primary responsibility for performance. OTR v. Flakey Jake's, Inc., 112 Wn.2d 243, 248, 770 P.2d 629 (1989). On March 1, 1983, B&B assigned its leasehold interest to Floor Supply Distributing, Inc., again without obtaining Wilkening's written consent. Nonetheless, as with B&B, Wilkening accepted the rent payments without objection.\nIn 1983 following significant water leakage, Floor Supply had the warehouse roof examined by a roofing contractor. This inspection revealed the roof's deteriorated condition and the need for an entire reroofing. The west end was in the worst condition.\nOn August 24, 1983, Wilkening's attorney sent Watkins a letter advising the roof on the west end was in need of immediate repair and maintenance; that Watkins was responsible pursuant to the lease to repair it; and absent action by Watkins, the roof would be repaired at Wilken-ing's direction and repayment sought. Watkins disagreed. Thereafter Wilkening had the west portion of the roof replaced at a cost of $8,828.82, and with a cover letter, sent the work invoice to Watkins seeking reimbursement. Watkins declined payment.\nThe rest of the roof continued to leak causing damage to Floor Supply's inventory. On October 9, 1985, Wilkening's attorney sent a similar letter to Watkins indicating the need to reroof the remaining portions. A bid was acquired and forwarded to Watkins. Upon receiving no response, Wilkening had the work performed in August 1986. The total cost was $22,353.89. Once again, Wilkening's request for reimbursement was declined by Watkins based on a denial of liability.\nWilkening brought this action seeking reimbursement for the entire cost of the reroofing. There is evidence that a tar roof requires a maintenance coat of tar, usually applied with a mop, every 3 to 5 years. The original tar roof was guaranteed by the roofing contractor for 10 years provided this maintenance program is followed. While there is factual dispute as to the average age of a tar roof, the court found that the roof lasted beyond its life expectancy. The court further found it was the intent of the parties that this roof would \""endure the leasehold period,\"" i.e., 15 years. The court concluded Watkins breached the general maintenance clause of the lease by failing to maintain the roof. Damages were imposed for the costs of roof replacement along with attorney fees and costs.\nThe primary issue is whether the lease's general maintenance provision imposes a duty upon Watkins as lessee to apply periodic hot tar treatments to the roof of the leased building.\nIn interpreting a lease, we examine the document itself and \""determine the mutual intentions of the contracting parties according to the reasonable meaning of their words and acts.\"" Fisher Properties, Inc. v. Arden-Mayfair, Inc., 106 Wn.2d 826, 837, 726 P.2d 8 (1986). \""[W]hat controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used.\"" Washington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, 96 Wn.2d 322, 328, 635 P.2d 138 (1981) (citing Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897)). \""Leases are contracts, as well as conveyances, and as such the rules of construction that apply to contracts also apply to leases.\"" Seattle-First Nat'l Bank v. Westlake Park Assocs., 42 Wn. App. 269, 272, 711 P.2d 361 (1985), review denied, 105 Wn.2d 1015 (1986).\nThe 1978 lease, paragraph 7, provides in pertinent part:\nMAINTENANCE\n[T]he tenant shall have sole responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the rental unit covered by this lease. The tenant at its expense shall maintain the rental unit in every respect, in a state of good repair and in good condition throughout the term of this lease.\n(Italics ours.) (The paragraph continues as to the tenant's duty to maintain sidewalks and access ways free of ice and snow, keep all drainage pipes open, the building properly heated, and replace any broken glass.)\nParagraph 8 states in part:\nTenant shall assume, exclusively, full risk for damage to the rental unit including but not restricted to the building and fixtures which may result from fire, from the elements and from any other cause.\n(Italics ours.) (The lease then speaks of the tenant's responsibility to maintain fire insurance.)\nParagraph 11 states in part:\nUpon termination of the lease the premises shall be returned to the possession of Landlords in condition as good as they are at the time possession thereof is taken by Tenant, subject, however, to reasonable wear and tear which will have taken place through normal use by Tenant.\nThere is no provision designating either party's responsibility for the roof, as was found in Puget Inv. Co. v. Wenck, 36 Wn.2d 817, 221 P.2d 459, 20 A.L.R.2d 1320 (1950) and McManamon v. Tobiason, 75 Wash. 46, 134 P. 524 (1913). Nor is there anything in the record to indicate the issue of maintaining the roof was discussed by the original parties to the lease or that Watkins and its assignees were aware, at the inception of the lease or assignment, that a tar roof required a mop maintenance every 3 to 5 years. Watkins defended on the theory that a roof was a structural part of the building, which might from time to time require major and permanent repairs, and thus not the tenant's responsibility.\nWashington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, supra, held in part that a general obligation to maintain the premises and upon expiration of the lease surrender it in as good condition as when the lessee took possession, except for ordinary wear and tear, did not require lessee to rebuild the premises when it was destroyed by fire. Thus, the court overruled the common law as enunciated in Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897) and its progeny. However, as noted earlier, the court stated: \""As we said in Armstrong, what controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used. ... We will not extend the obligation of lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used ...\"" Payne, at 328.\nAs noted previously, this lease provides the tenant has \""the sole responsibility for maintenance and repair\"" of the unit, at its expense, in every respect; further, that the tenant \""assume[s], exclusively, full risk for damage\"" to the unit, be it from fire, from the elements, or from any other cause. At the conclusion of paragraph 8, from which the preceding text was taken and after discussion of insurance coverage, the lease provides: \""Landlords shall have no responsibility whatsoever.\"" This combination of language imposes a heavy responsibility upon the tenant; the trial court so found in holding the tenant responsible for maintenance in order to permit the roof to endure during the leasehold period. The court's findings are supported by substantial evidence.\nWe find Watkins' analogy to Payne, while not requiring rebuilding of a destroyed structure, is not applicable when replacement of a roof covering is a result of the tenant's failure to perform proper maintenance as required by the terms of the lease.\nThe lease provides for attorney fees.\nThe judgment is affirmed and the case remanded for determination of reasonable attorney fees on appeal.\nThompson, C.J., and Green, J., concur.\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied October 19, 1989.\nReview denied at 114 Wn.2d 1003 (1990).\nRake's Mountain Distributors subsequently changed its name to Watkins Distributors.\nThe warehouse building is 105 feet in width and approximately 507 feet in length. It is divided by two parapets which separate the roof into three sections. The first, the west end, was constructed in 1968, consisted of 13,000 square feet, was recoated in 1975 per the terms of the original lease and was reroofed in 1984. The second, the center section, was constructed in 1973, consisted of 24,000 square feet, and was reroofed in August 1986. The third section, the east end, was constructed in 1974, consisted of 13,000 square feet, and was reroofed in August 1986. It was to be used only as a wholesale beverage distributorship unless consent of the lessor was given.\nWhile examination of the lease language as a whole provides for such a result, a specific provision dealing with hot tar treatment, including time frames, and allocation of responsibility for the same would avoid such problems in the future."""
