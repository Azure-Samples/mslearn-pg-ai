615468,"Le Vette v. Hardman Estate","""Morris, J.\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\n“That the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor’s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.”\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, § 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant’s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be’held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\nCrow, C. J., Parker, Fullerton, and Mount, JJ., concur."""
1034620,"Jorgensen v. Massart","""Hill, J.\nThis is an appeal from a summary judgment dismissing an action for damages.\nThe factual situation presented to the trial court on the motion for summary judgment, based on the pleadings, a deposition and affidavits, was as follows:\nThe plaintiff, Gertrude Jorgensen, went to lunch with her married daughter. When they returned to the Jorgen-sen apartment, they found water on the floor of the kitchen and it was just beginning to spread to the living room. They moved some furniture, rolled back a rug, and “dammed” the water with towels and bath mats, thus preventing the encroachment of the water into the living room. The rug and furnishings belonged to the plaintiffs. The damming operation was not completely effective, as some “did trickle out and went down the hall and to the guest closet.”\nThe water came from a water line fitting broken by the representatives of the defendant plumbing company while installing a hot water tank in an apartment adjacent to that of the Jorgensens, and the water escaped until such time as it could be shut off at the meter.\nMrs. Jorgensen and her daughter did nothing further until the water was shut off, but did report the fact that there was water in the apartment to the wife of the manager of the apartment.\nIt is conceded that no one asked Mrs. Jorgensen to clear the water from the kitchen floor and that 30 to 40 minutes elapsed from the time that she discovered the water before she undertook, entirely on her own volition, the work of mopping it up.\nShe prepared herself for that work by changing her clothes, putting on a pair of jeans and a sweat shirt, and canvas deck shoes with rubber soles. The method used in getting the water off the kitchen floor was to sop it with towels, wring the towels out in a large container, and then empty the contents of the container into the sink. This continued from some time “after 2:00, probably 2:15, 2:30,” until about 4:00 o’clock. Her hands and feet were in the cold water during all of that time.\nThere is no showing that Mrs. Jorgensen asked the plumbing company or the owner of the apartment to do anything about clearing the water out of her apartment; nor is there any showing that either of them offered to do anything about the situation, except that Mrs. Jorgensen in her deposition testified:\n“ . . . As I was about through a man from the plumbing shop came in and wanted to know if he could give us some help, and I said, ‘No, I’ve got it licked now.’ ”\nShe contracted laryngitis and was hospitalized, allegedly as a result of her contact with the cold water. The action was against the plumbing company, which was doing the work, and the owners of the apartment for damages sustained in consequence of Mrs. Jorgensen’s exposure to the cold water.\nIt is the position of the defendants here, that if it is assumed that there is a jury question, as to the negligence of the defendants, that this is a classic example of volenti non fit injuria and that, in any event, Mrs. Jorgensen was contributorily negligent as a matter of law.\nWe explained that maxim in Walsh v. West Coast Coal Mines (1948), 31 Wn. (2d) 396, 407, 411, 197 P. (2d) 233, 239, quoting from Gover v. Central Vermont R. Co. (1922), 96 Yt. 208, 118 Atl. 874:\n“ ‘If one knowing and comprehending the danger voluntarily exposes himself to it, though not negligent in so doing, he is deemed to have assumed the risk and is precluded from a recovery for an injury resulting therefrom. The maxim is predicated upon the theory of knowledge and appreciation of the danger and voluntary assent thereto.’ ”\nAnd, by way of further explanation, we quoted from White v. McVicker (1933), 216 Iowa 90, 246 N. W. 385:\n“ ‘The sum total of the application of this doctrine simply stated is that, where one is placed in the position where he has his choice of doing or not doing a given act, this doctrine applies.’ ”\nWe have here neither life, limb, nor property being endangered. We have no hasty or impulsive action. At least 30 minutes and perhaps “close to an hour,” elapsed between the discovery of the water on the kitchen floor and the decision to “sop” it up. There was a change of clothes in preparation for that work.\nThis states the case as strongly as it can be stated for the defendants here. However, there remains the question as to what reasonable election or alternative was left to the plaintiff.\nThe issues raised by this appeal included the three questions asked in Kingwell v. Hart (1954), 45 Wn. (2d) 401, 405, 406, 275 P. (2d) 431, 434, 435. The first two, i.e.,\n“ . . . Did plaintiff (1) know of and appreciate the danger or risk involved, and also (2) did he voluntarily consent to expose himself to it voluntarily’ including the meaning that defendant’s conduct has left plaintiff a reasonable election or alternative. See Emerick v. Mayr, 39 Wn. (2d) 23, 25, 234 P. (2d) 1079 (1951)), . . .’’(Italics ours)\nmust be answered in the affirmative to establish the defense of volenti non fit injuria. And the third question,\n“ . . . (3) was the exposure unreasonable, that is, was it such that a reasonable person in plaintiff’s position would not expose himself to it, or, after accepting a reasonable risk, did plaintiff exercise proper care for his own protection against that risk.”\nmust be answered in the affirmative to establish contributory negligence.\nIt is apparent that Mrs. Jorgensen, after stopping the flow of water into the living room and confining it to the kitchen, did not impetuously, hastily, or inadvisedly enter into the project of removing the water. She waited for the running water to be cut off, then arrayed herself for the task. The remaining question is: did she have a reasonable election or alternative. If she didn’t sop or mop up this water, which had flooded her kitchen, who was going to do it. She was confronted with the further question of how long her dam of towels and bath mats would be effective.\nIt may well be that, if tried, there would be testimony that as soon as they had remedied the more emergent condition in the apartment, where the water connection had broken, the defendants would have taken care of the situation in the Jorgensen apartment, had she waited. The offer of assistance from the plumbing company employee, to which we have referred, might be some indication that such would have been the case. But that is all conjecture; there is no suggestion of it in the record; and if that was so, how was Mrs. Jorgensen to know it. Enough has been said to indicate that, in our opinion, there was a question of fact: Did Mrs. Jorgensen have a reasonable alternative? This a jury would have to pass upon before the defendants could establish their defense of volenti non fit injuria.\nThe test, on the issue of contributory negligence, was whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would have exposed himself to the risks inherent in mopping and sopping up the water on the kitchen floor; and, if after accepting a reasonable risk, the plaintiff exercised proper care for his own protection against that risk.\nThe Restatement says:\n“It is not contributory negligence for a plaintiff to expose himself to danger in a reasonable effort to save a third person or the land or chattels of himself or a third person from harm.” Restatement, Torts § 472 (1934); and, in the next section:\n“If the defendant’s negligence has made the plaintiff’s exercise of a right or privilege impossible unless he knowingly exposes himself to a risk of bodily harm, the plaintiff is not guilty of contributory negligence in so doing unless the risk is unreasonable.” Restatement, Torts § 473 (1934).\nMrs. Jorgensen’s right to the use of her kitchen is apparent. We are satisfied that whether a reasonably prudent and cautious individual, in like circumstances, would have proceeded to get the water off the kitchen floor, is a jury question; and we so hold.\nThe defendants also urge, in support of the summary judgment of dismissal, that the laryngitis of the plaintiff was an injury which could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as the probable result of any negligence for which they may be responsible. They cite, and rely on, Ottevaere v. Spokane (1916), 89 Wash. 681, 155 Pac. 146.\nWe have approached foreseeability with telescopic lenses since Ottevaere and 1916. See Orcutt v. Spokane Cy. (1961), 58 Wn. (2d) 846, 364 P. (2d) 1102; McLeod v. Grant Cy. School Dist. (1953), 42 Wn. (2d) 316, 322, 255 P. (2d) 360; Berglund v. Spokane Cy. (1940), 4 Wn. (2d) 309, 319, 103 P. (2d) 355; Frazee v. Western Dairy Products (1935), 182 Wash. 578, 47 P. (2d) 1037.\nIn the Berglund and McLeod cases we quoted Harper (1938), Torts § 7, p. 15:\n\""... The manner in which the risk culminates in harm may be unusual, improbable and highly unexpectable, from the point of view of the actor at the time of his conduct. And yet, if the harm suffered falls within the general danger area, there may be liability, provided other requisites of legal causation are present.”\nAs early as 1917 we were distinguishing the Ottevaere case in Hellan v. Supply Laundry Co. (1917), 94 Wash. 683, 689, 163 Pac. 9, saying:\n“ . . . This court, in common with some others, has said that ‘any injury which could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as the probable result of an act of negligence is not actionable,’ in that the act is too remote to be a proximate cause. Ottevaere v. Spokane, 89 Wash. 681, 155 Pac. 146. But that language must not be taken in an absolute sense. It does not mean that the probability of injury must be so obvious as to be necessarily anticipated by the wrongdoer, nor does it mean that he must have reasonably anticipated that injury would probably result to the exact person or in the exact form or way in which it did result. ...”\nWe certainly can not, on the record before us, say that the laryngitis of the plaintiff could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as a result of the flooding of the plaintiff’s kitchen, which for the purposes of this opinion we have assumed to be the result of the negligence of the defendants.\nThe defendants had the burden, as the party moving for a summary judgment, to show that there were no genuine issues of fact. Preston v. Duncan (1960), 55 Wn. (2d) 678, 349 P. (2d) 605. This they failed to do.\nThe summary judgment of dismissal is reversed.\nWeaver, Rosellini, Hunter, and Hale, JJ., concur.\nSee Handler v. Osman (1962), 60 Wn. (2d) 800, 804, 376 P. (2d) 439. 442."""
1279441,"Tope v. King County","""Steinert, C. J.\nAppellants, as plaintiffs, brought this action to recover damages to real property caused by the invasion of surface waters, and to obtain an injunction against the future diversion of such waters to the injury of their property. Trial before the court without a jury resulted in a judgment dismissing the action, following which this appeal was taken.\nAppellants, husband and wife, are contract purchasers of a tract of land in King county, described as the south 300 feet of the north 602.64 feet of government lot 1, section 32, township 22 1ST., range 4 E. W. M., located about twenty miles south of Seattle and one mile from Redondo beach. The land has a frontage of three hundred feet on Puget Sound' and extends back eastwardly about twelve hundred feet to a county road, described and known as the W. A. Hall road, which runs in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction.\nFor a short distance west of the Hall road’, appellants’ land has a gentle slope toward Puget Sound, then breaks somewhat steeply, forming a hillside which ends about midway in the length of appellants’ land; at the foot of the hill, the ground levels off onto a bench which extends westwardly to a low bluff overlooking the beach.\nAlong the northerly portion of appellants’ land, and running parallel with, and about thirty feet from, their north line, there was, prior to the circumstances hereinafter related, the vestige of an old abandoned skid-way, or logging road, which formed a depression of two or three feet in the ground, and in the bed of which ran a small stream fed by springs in the rear of the property and emptying through a small trough onto the beach bordering’ the Sound.\nUpon appellants’ property are three ditches. One comes from the adjacent land on the north and formerly connected' with the little stream flowing along the bed of the old skidway. The second runs south of the stream but does not connect with it; its waters, which 'are small in amount, are diffused upon the ground in the immediate vicinity. The third ditch diverts the surface waters from the hill in the rear and conducts them southwestwardly, away from the direction of the little stream, to the Sound.\nAppellants ’ land is improved with a two-story frame house and a garage, located on the level area and near the bluff; it also has upon it a natural grove of alder, maple, and fir trees. Appellants occupy the premises during the summer and on week ends, and, during their occupancy since 1924, have cleared out some of the stumps, done some landscaping, and put in plants and shrubs.\nOn the land lying to the north of, and opposite, the middle portion of appellants’ property, is a large swamp or basin, about one hundred fifty feet wide from east to west and approximately seven hundred feet long from north to south, the southerly end of which is approximately one hundred or one hundred fifty feet from appellants’ north line, and the northerly end of which lies in section 29, which is immediately north of section 32. This basin, which is bounded on the east and west by ranges of hills, has no natural inlet or outlet. At its southern extremity, there is an artificial ditch or channel which extends to, and connects with, the depression made by the skidway on appellants ’ land.\nEast of the Hall road and comprising from forty to one hundred acres lying in the northeast quarter, of section 32, is an area of unimproved land, referred to in the record as the Betts area. Along the east line of section 32, which is also the eastern boundary of the Betts area, runs the Seattle-Tacoma Highline road. Along the north line of section 32, which is also the northern boundary of the Betts area, runs another county road, known as the W. J. Betts road, which extends from the Seattle-Tacoma Highline road 'on the east to the Hall road on the west.\nThe greater part of the Betts area is flat and swampy and contains many earth pockets. This area drains to the north in the direction of the Betts road. Within the Betts area and approximately one hundred fifty feet east of the Hall road, is a natural ridge of ground running north and south the full width of appellant's’ land and extending north of, and beyond, the Betts road'. This ridge, acting as a barrier, has the effect of turning the drainage of the Betts area away from appellants’ land. Beyond, or north of, the Betts road, the land slopes to the north and west, so that the natural drainage of the area on both sides of the Betts road is ultimately in those directions toward Puget Sound and beyond the north end' of the basin or swamp, previously mentioned, and considerably north of appellants’ property. The outlet of the waters from this area into Puget Sound is through Woodmont Beach canyon, which, also, lies considerably north of appellants’ land.\nThe Betts road was built in 1930, and, at the time of its construction, the county put a ditch along its south side up to about the point where the natural ridge crosses the road, and also installed an eight-inch culvert about half way between the Hall road and the Seattle-Tacoma Highline road for the purpose of allowing the surface waters from the Betts area to drain to the north in their natural way. To connect with the Hall road, the Betts road cuts through the natural ridge which runs parallel to appellants’ property.\nSome time after the Betts road had been constructed, and' prior to 1933, the county extended the ditch running along its south side to the western terminus of the road and placed an eight-inch culvert underneath the Hall road at its junction with the Betts road, which point is about two hundred ninety feet north of the north line of appellants’ property. Through this culvert, a small amount of water was able to flow westwardly from the Betts area underneath and across the Hall road and, after diffusing itself over the ground, become absorbed within a short distance from the outlet of the culvert. Prior to January, 1935, however, practically all of the surface waters which drained from the Betts area flowed northwardly through the eight-inch culvert underneath the Betts road, without any damage whatever to appellants.\nOn Sunday, January 20, 1935, appellants, who resided in Seattle during the winter months, visited their country place, which is the property involved here. There were then six or eight inches of snow on the ground, hut no damage to their property had occurred. Their next visit to the property was on the following Sunday, January 27,1935. In the meantime, on January 21st, there had been a sudden thaw, accompanied by a heavy rain.\nWhen appellants visited their property on January 27th, they found that water from some source had' washed a large gully along the course of the old skid road situated on their land. The washout thus made was approximately 235 feet long, 35 feet wide, and from 10 to 20 feet deep. A number of trees had been uprooted and had fallen into the gully. Three or four thousand yards of earth had been washed out onto the beach, forming a kind of peninsula covering'an area of about two hundred fifty by one hundred feet. A computation of the earth deposited on the beach disclosed that it exceeded the amount that came from the gully itself, indicating that a part of the earth had been carried from a point further up. The little stream which formerly ran along the depression formed by the old' skid road had been enlarged many times, and water was then freely flowing therein.\nThe appellant husband, accompanied by a witness, traced the source of the water and found that, at the junction of the Hall and Betts roads, an eighteen-inch culvert had been recently installed, permitting the water to flow in large volume from the ditch paralleling the Betts road toward and' underneath the Hall road. It appears that the new culvert had been installed by the county on or about January 20, 1935, for the express purpose of carrying underneath and across the Hall road the surface waters which normally and naturally drained from the Betts area northwardly into the ditch running alongside the Betts road'. The waters emptying through the eighteen-inch culvert formed a distinct channel for a short distance and then faded out as they spread and became diffused upon a terrain covered by underbrush and' honeycombed with mountain-beaver holes.\nOn account of the slope of the ground in that vicinity, the water naturally drained into the basin or swamp above mentioned, the deepest part of which was at its southern extremity lying near appellants’ land. Any increase of water in the basin naturally found its outlet through the artificial ditch leading therefrom toward the old skid road' running through the land of appellants. At the time that the appellant husband and the accompanying witness made their inspection, the water was pouring through the eighteen-inch culvert, while none was flowing through the eight-inch culvert midway in the Betts road.\nIt appears that, in December, 1933, which was after the Betts road had been built, but before the eighteen-inch culvert had been installed, a slide had occurred on the property north of appellants’ land and, in consequence thereof, the owner of that land had moved his house further back to the east. At the time that this slide occurred, there had been an unusually heavy rainfall, and, as a result, there had been a small slide of earth on appellants’ land, near the mouth of the little stream coursing along the old skid road. A few trees had toppled over, but other than that, there was no damage to appellants. So far as is known, there had been no other slides nor any washouts upon appellants’ land prior to that time.\nAfter making repeated complaints, both written and oral, to the proper county authorities, concerning the damage done and also concerning what would likely recur under the conditions then existing, and after taking an assignment from their vendors of all claims for damages to the property, the appellants brought this action for the relief requested.\nThe answer of the respondent consisted of a general denial and also an affirmative defense to the effect that any damages which appellants suffered were the result of an unusual and unprecedented rainfall, which the respondent could not, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, have foreseen and guarded against in the construction and maintenance of its highway system.\nThe theory of appellants’ case is that the damage to their property was caused by the wrongful acts of the county in diverting the surface waters which originated upon the Betts area away from the course of their natural drainage, conducting them through the barrier ridge which protected appellants’ property, and discharging them through the eighteen-inch culvert onto a hillside which naturally drained into the basin or swamp above appellants’ property, as a natural consequence of which, the overburden of water in the basin escaped through the ditch at its south end and flowed in a torrent over appellants’ land', causing the destruction complained of.\nThe theory of the respondent is that appellants’ property is a focal point for large quantities of water; that the land is of sliding material; that, in the winter months, the ground becomes saturated with water and, because of its topography, is subject to slides; that the heavy snow on January 20, 1935, followed by a steady downpour of rain, formed' a sea of water which, because of the slope of appellants’ land, poured into and along the bed of the old skid road, loosening the earth and carrying it forward in a mass; that these waters had their sources on the hillside back of appellants ’ land; and that the havoc created was wholly unaffected by waters draining from the Betts area and flowing upon the land bordering appellants’ property.\nThese two theories, respectively, were the interpretations of two opposing engineers, both of whom were men of experience and prominence. The two theories were, of course, widely divergent, and the court was put to the choice of adopting one or the other. As to the actual facts of the case, however, there was little, if any, material dispute.\nThe law applicable to the case, we think, is expressed in two principles, both of which were referred to in the court’s memorandum decision.\nThe first principle is this: One on whose land surface and outlaw waters flow, may not collect such waters in drains or artificial channels and cast them on the lands of others, or so near thereto that they will find their way thereon, to the damage of others. Peters v. Lewis, 28 Wash. 366, 68 Pac. 869; Noyes v. Cosselman, 29 Wash. 635, 70 Pac. 61, 92 Am. St. 937; Sullivan v. Johnson, 30 Wash. 72, 70 Pac. 246; Rohsnagel v. Northern Pac. R.

(2d) 352; 3 Farnham, Waters and Water Rights, pp. 885, 886; 3 Kinney on Irrigation and Water Rights (2d ed.), p. 2969.\nNor does it make any difference whether the waters are cast immediately upon the land of a complaining-owner or upon lands from which they inevitably flow onto his land. The proximate cause is the original wrong in diverting the water so as to cause the harm. Wendel v. Spokane County, 27 Wash. 121, 67 Pac. 576, 91 Am. St. 825.\nThe other principle is this: When two causes combine to produce an injury, both of which are, in their nature, proximate and contributory to the injury, one being a culpable negligent act of the defendant, and the other being an act of God for which neither party is responsible, then the defendant is liable for such loss as is caused by his own act concurring with the act of God, provided the loss would not have been sustained by plaintiff but for such negligence of the defendant. The burden of proof, however, is upon the defendant to show that the loss is due solely to an act of God. Mulrone v. Marshall, 35 Mont. 238, 88 Pac. 797; Raish v. Orchard Canal Co., 67 Mont. 140, 218 Pac. 655; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. McKone, 36 Okla. 41, 127 Pac. 488, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 709; Miller v. Mobile & Ohio R. Co., 265 Ill. App. 414, 418; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Hendry, 112 Fla. 391, 150 So. 598; Willie v. Minnesota Power & Light Co., 190 Minn. 95, 250 N. W. 809, 811; 45 C. J. 926, § 489; 27 R. C. L. 1107.\nHaving these principles in mind, we are of the opinion that appellants established a case of liability on the part of the county and that respondent failed to meet the burden assumed by it in its affirmative defense. We are also of the opinion that the court, when put to the election of a theory concerning the cause of the injury, did not accept the more logical and convincing hypothesis.\nThe record leaves little room for doubt that, during the period' involved, an enormous amount of water drained from the Betts area into the ditch along the south side of the Betts road. It is conceded that, normally, such waters would drain northwardly, away from appellants’ land, and, unless diverted, would' not reach their land at all. The ditch was purposely extended through the natural barrier, and a large eighteen-inch culvert was deliberately placed by the county under the Hall road. The fact is, and the court expressly found, that the purpose of the county in installing the culvert was to carry the surface waters from the Betts area underneath and across the Hall road and discharge them upon the transverse side of the ridge. It is admitted that, when so discharged', the waters would ultimately and naturally drain into the basin or sink lying between the hills and, in consequence, would flow out through the artificial ditch at its southern extremity onto the land of appellants.\nEvery logical inference from the facts established by the evidence points unerringly to the source of the waters, or at least a large part of them. The initial wrong was committed when respondent, by means of its ditch and culvert, diverted the waters from their natural course and cast them upon lands whose topography was such as to make appellants’ land their inevitable recipient. Appellants’ case falls squarely within the first principle of law above announced.\nConsidering the unusual snowfall, the sudden thaw, and the heavy rain as acts of God, and' assuming that a part of the waters which caused the damage came from the hillside in the rear of appellants’ land, the burden was, nevertheless, upon the respondent to show that the damage to appellants was wholly unaffected by the waters which came from the Betts area. But, as already suggested, we are convinced from the record that this burden of proof was not met by respondent.\nIf the waters from the Betts area were not a potent factor for immediate havoc, the respondent would hardly have availed itself of the means that it did to escape the risk of having its roads inundated and washed away. By installing the eighteen-inch culvert, respondent shifted from itself the possibility of sustaining damage, and cast the risk upon appellants. It cannot now attribute the damage to another cause over which it had no control, without assuming and meeting the burden of showing either that its own act was not a contributing cause or else that the damage to appellants would have occurred regardless of anything that respondent did.\nWe have carefully considered the reasons assigned by respondent’s expert witness and his theory of the cause of the damage. That theory, if accepted, would probably absolve the respondent from liability. But the witness did not see the premises at the time that the damage was wrought. His testimony, given in the form of an opinion as to a past event, was based on information derived from a survey of the land made by himself many years ago and a more detailed inspection made by him ten months after the occurrence. On the other hand, appellants ’ expert witness had a much better opportunity to evaluate the contributing causes, inasmuch as he visited and carefully investigated the situation within a reasonably short time after the damage occurred. In our opinion, the outstanding facts of the case, as shown by the evidence, afford a very substantial basis for the conclusions reached by him.\nIn a case involving a somewhat similar situation, the United States supreme court used this language:\n‘‘It is difficult for a court to decide issues of fact upon which experts equal in number and standing differ flatly and when their conclusions rest on estimates upon the correctness of which the court, without technical knowledge, can not undertake to pass. In such cases, the court looks about for outstanding facts from which the lay mind can safely draw inferences as to their probabilities. The court is also aided by its judgment of the care and accuracy with which the contrasted experts respectively have determined the data upon which they base their conclusions.” North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 365, 44 S. Ct. 138, 68 L. Ed. 342.\nWe appreciate the fact that the trial court made findings in the case, and we are mindful of the rule that such findings are to be treated as verities unless the evidence clearly preponderates against them. But, in this case, the findings, except those which adopt the theory of respondent’s expert witness, are all consistent with a conclusion favorable to appellants. With respect to the opinions of the expert witnesses, we are in the same position as was the trial court in accepting that theory which is the most persuasive, since, after all, no question of credibility is involved, and it is only a matter of drawing conclusions from the facts shown and concerning which there is no material dispute.\nWe are convinced that the second principle of law above announced converges with the first, upon the evidence adduced, and makes a case of liability on the part of the respondent.\nThe judgment is reversed, with direction to the trial court to determine from the evidence already submitted, or from additional evidence, if the court deem it necessary, the amount of damages sustained by appellants, and to enter judgment accordingly.\nMain, Tolman, Beals, Blake, and Robinson, JJ., concur.\nMillard and G-eraghty, JJ., dissent."", ""Holcomb, J.\n(dissenting) — The opinion of the majority is erroneous upon any theory.

4938756,"Stevens v. King County","""Donworth, J.\nRespondents, as plaintiffs, brought this action against both the city of Seattle and Kang county to recover damages to real property caused by the invasion of surface waters. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs’ evidence, the trial court, sitting without a jury, sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence interposed by the county and dismissed the case as to that defendant. The trial then proceeded with the city as sole defendant, and at the conclusion thereof the trial court rendered an oral decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The city’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the oral decision having been denied, the court entered findings of fact and judgment for the plaintiffs against the city of Seattle, from which the latter has appealed.\nRespondents were represented in the trial court and in the perfecting of their appeal by counsel other than those who appeared for them at the time of the argument in this court.\nRespondents, husband and wife, are owners of a tract of land in King county, located a few blocks north of the city limits of Seattle at the northwest corner of North 102nd street and Aurora avenue. The property is bounded on the east by Aurora avenue, on the south by North 102nd street, and on the west by an alley which runs north and south parallel to Aurora avenue. About twenty feet north of respondents’ property, this alley is intersected by another alley running west to Linden avenue parallel to North 102nd street. Linden avenue, which runs northerly and southerly, is the next street to the west of Aurora avenue and intersects North 102nd street approximately one hundred yards west of respondents’ property. With the exception of Aurora avenue, which is a primary state..highway, all of these streets and alleys are unpaved county roads.\nRespondents’ land is improved by a store building located on the southern portion of the property, fronting on Aurora avenue, on the rear or west end of which two separate additions have been built which are used for living quarters and garage and storage purposes. The original store building has a concrete foundation wall, but the two additions rest on concrete blocks. Respondents became tenants of this property in 1942, purchased it in 1944 for five thousand dollars, and began to use the additions as their home on May 9,1946.\nIn order to understand the legal problems presented by this case, it is necessary to describe the topography of this area. North 102nd street is a graveled road which has been oiled and compacted. Immediately west of Aurora avenue, this street was graded by filling the traveled portion with gravel to an elevation somewhat higher than that of respondents’ property. For a distance of one hundred fifty feet west of Aurora avenue, the street surface is almost flat, having a very slight crown. The street then begins to rise in its westerly course so that, at its intersection with Linden avenue, its elevation is about twenty-five to thirty feet higher than its elevation adjacent to respondents’ property. West of Linden avenue, North 102nd street continues to rise for a considerable distance. The alley, abutting on respondents’ property on the west, slopes from north to south. The general slope of the ground and the natural drainage in this vicinity is from the northwest to the southeast in the direction of respondents’ property, which forms a sump or pothole.\nThe greater quantity of surface water arising on the hill to the west of respondents’ property travels south on Linden avenue to North 102nd street and east down that street to Aurora avenue. Some surface water flows east down the alley between North 102nd and North 103rd streets, turns into the alley to the west of respondents’ property, and runs south toward North 102nd. Except for Aurora avenue, there are no curbs, gutters, or sewers in this area for the purpose of carrying off the surface water.\nAccording to the testimony of respondent Sydney Stevens (who will be referred to as the respondent unless the context indicates otherwise), the surface wateri,had formed a small drainage ditch on the north side of North 102nd street to within one hundred feet of respondents’ property, where it then leveled out. Prior to January, 1948, according to his testimony, the surface water, with one exception, had always flowed past his property without entering thereon. The single exception was in 1945, when surface water settled in a puddle on North 102nd street near the front of the store building, but the water disappeared after the county deposited gravel in that spot. In respondents’ complaint, it was alleged that there had been repeated floodings of their premises since'May 9,1946, but at the trial respondent testified that this allegation was incorrect.\nOn January 20, 1948, the appellant, under a franchise from King county, commenced to lay water mains on North 102nd street connecting with an existing water main on Aurora avenue and running westward. This work was done by a contractor (to whom appellant had awarded this job) with the knowledge and under the supervision of the county engineer.\nA trench, approximately two feet wide and forty-four inches deep, was dug by appellant’s contractor ten feet north of, and parallel to, the center line of the street and twenty feet from the south edge of respondents’ property. The dirt was piled three or four feet high on the south side of the trench. The pipe was laid in eighteen-foot sections, and that portion of the trench was backfilled with earth and water on the same day. Two or three days later, the surface of the street was smoothed off with the blade of a “scoopmobile” (bulldozer with rubber tires). The surface dirt was removed by the contractor and dumped in a place remote from respondents’ property.\nThe alley to the west of respondents’ property was not disturbed in any manner, since no lateral pipes were laid. The job was completed in five days on January 24, 1948. Respondent testified that, after the appellant finished its installation, a barrier of dirt about one foot high was left, which remained several days, but the street was leveled before the rain came in February, 1948.\nThe evidence shows that the job was rather carefully inspected at every stage by both the appellant and King county to make certain that the street was left in the same condition that it was when the job was started. However, no measurements were taken to determine the precise level of the street either before or after the construction. Respondent testified that prior to the time appellant installed the water main the street was not in very good condition and had been neglected by the county. After flooding involved in this action, the county constructed a ditch on the north side of North 102nd street which has since conducted' surface water past respondents’ property to the sewer in Aurora avenue.\nDuring the actual laying of the water main, very little rain fell, but between the 13th and 18th of February, 1948, two and thirty-five hundredths inches of rain fell in this area.\nOn February 24, 1948, respondents filed their claim for damages with the appellant city of Seattle, as well as with the county. This claim not having been acted upon within sixty days from the filing thereof, this action was thereafter commenced. Paragraphs VII, VIII and IX of this claim stated as follows:\n“VII\n“On February 16, 1948, and prior and subsequent thereto, there was a substantial rainfall, and the surface waters and seepage flowing on said streets and alleys entered upon the claimants’ property in great volume.\n“VIII\n“As a result of the repeated flooding of claimants’ premises since May 9, 1946, the soil has been gradually washed away from under the foundation walls of claimants’ house and store building, causing the walls thereof to sag, causing distortions and displacements in the structure of said building. Many of the wooden timbers thereof which have been subjected to repeated water damage have become rotten, and a wooden stairway into the basement of the premises at 10207 Aurora has completely rotted out. The ground under the board walk leading from the sidewalk on North 102nd Street to claimants’ front door has been washed away, causing the walk to sink. The aforesaid flooding has also damaged claimants’ lawn and shrubbery.\n“IX\n“The aforesaid damage has been gradual and cumulative, increasing with the flooding of claimants’ property which has occurred after each rainfall.”\nThe contention of respondents is that the damage complained of was caused by appellant’s changing the street contours while making a public improvement which resulted in the surface water flowing down the street being diverted onto their property. They maintain that the judgment can be supported either upon the constitutional provision against damaging private property for a public use (Art. I, § 16) or upon the theory of appellant’s negligence. The trial court in its oral decision indicated that respondents’ recovery in this action was based on the city’s negligence.\nOn the other hand, appellant contends that there is absolutely no proof that surface water was collected by it and discharged upon respondents’ property in a concentrated form, and that there is no proof that the laying of the water main in North 102nd street resulted in any changing of the street contours so as to cause the flooding. Furthermore, it is argued that respondent did nothing to mitigate his damages, although he was aware of the flooding and could have protected his property at nominal expense.\nAppellant assigns as error the making of finding off fact No. VII, the failure to sustain appellant’s challenge to the sufficiency of respondents’ evidence, and the entry of judgment against the city for the sum of five hundred dollars.\nFinding No. VII reads as follows:\n“At the time defendant City performed such work on North 102nd Street, there was no substantial rainfall. Approximately in the middle of February, 1948, there was a heavy rainfall, with the result that large amounts of surface waters collected on the high ground west of plaintiffs’ property, and by virtue of the crown of North 102nd Street were prevented from flowing in their natural southeasterly course, but were conducted by open ditches on Linden Avenue and North 102nd Street to the intersection of said streets and thence east down North 102nd to the flat area immediately adjacent to plaintiffs’ property. By reason of the fact that defendant City had altered the contours of said street, the said surface waters thence flowed upon plaintiffs’ property in large volume, causing the foundations of their said buildings to settle, with resulting damage as hereinafter described. But for the construction work done by the defendant City as aforesaid, the said waters would have continued to flow in said street until reaching Aurora Avenue, whence they would have been conducted away by adequate drainage facilities, all without damage to plaintiff, as had been formerly the case.”\nWe have italicized the portion of this finding which is particularly to be .noted in connection with our discussion of the evidence in this case. Primarily, only questions of fact are here involved. North 102nd street, being outside of the city limits of Seattle, was entirely under the jurisdiction and control of King county. Therefore our decision in Kuhr v. Seattle, 15 Wn. (2d) 501, 131 P. (2d) 168 (cited by respondent), is not applicable.\nRespondent calls our attention to the well-established rule that findings of the trial court made upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed by this court unless we can say that such findings are clearly not supported by the weight of the evidence, citing Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 32 Wn. (2d) 256, 201 P. (2d) 207.\nFrom an examination of the entire record in this case, we are constrained to hold that the weight of the evidence does preponderate against the above-quoted finding. We will briefly state our reasons for so holding.\n1. Respondent’s claim against the city and county as well as the complaint (both were admitted in evidence) alleged that there had been repeated floodings of the premises since May, 1946, and that the damage had been gradual and cumulative. At the trial, he testified that these statements were erroneous, but his own witness Meroney, a former neighbor, testified in his deposition that there had been repeated floodings since 1946.\n2. This finding was made in spite of the trial court’s appraisal of respondent’s testimony as unsatisfactory. In its oral decision, the trial court commented upon respondent’s credibility as follows:\n“But I must concede to counsel that the re-reading of this plaintiff’s testimony does not convince me that I would be permitted to found my conclusions upon his sometimes rather disturbing testimony. He was quite an opinionated man and at times was almost flippant, not only towards his own counsel, but towards the Court and everybody else; and it was difficult to get from him just exactly what the facts were. He was bound to argue his case, and that made his own counsel’s problem somewhat difficult, as it did the rest of us.\n“But, apparently, he does not contend and does not claim to the Court that there was any dam left, a dam of loose earth left there at this point, ten feet north of the center of 102d Street at the time when the flood of -which he complains actually occurred.”\nSince respondent’s testimony was not considered by the trial court as adequate to support its findings, there was no credible testimony as to the essential facts to support the judgment other than that contained in the deposition of Mr. Meroney (whom the trial court did not see or hear testify). The court characterized Mr. Meroney’s testimony as “not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.” The latter’s testimony was outweighed by that produced by appellant.\n3. In opposition to these two witnesses, five witnesses were called by appellant, to wit, the King county district foreman, an engineer employed by the county engineer’s office, the city’s contractor who performed the work, the engineer in charge of the work for the city, and the district engineer for the city. All of them testified that the surface of North 102nd street in the vicinity of respondent’s property was in substantially the same condition after the water main was laid as before this work was done. Thus, the weight of the evidence is to the effect that the city did not change the contours of the street.\n4. In testifying in rebuttal, respondent admitted that the ridge of earth which he claimed appellant had left in the street after this work was completed was leveled off before the heavy rain came in February, 1948. Respondent’s only remaining cause of the flooding was that the city had changed the contours of the street. This is discussed in the preceding paragraph.\n5. The preponderance of the evidence does not support the above-quoted finding because respondent did not sustain the burden of proving that the laying of the water main by the city was the proximate cause of the flooding. Disregarding for the moment respondent’s allegations that there had been repeated flooding since 1946, his evidence merely showed that the flooding here involved occurred during the first heavy rain subsequent to the completion of the work, whereas no flooding took place just prior to doing the work at a time when there was also considerable rainfall.\nRespondent in his brief argues that the photographs taken by him, at the time the flooding occurred, show conclusively that most of the water which damaged his premises came from North 102nd street and not from the alley which forms the westerly boundary of his property. Four of these pictures have been enlarged, and we have given all of them careful consideration. The trial court’s comment regarding these pictures in its oral decision was as follows:\n“But this water, he [respondent] claims, came, in part, down the alley to the west of his property, and partly from the west. I think he suggested he thinks about five times the quantity from the west and probably one quarter from a point to the west, meeting up with one coming from this property.\n“Col. Nelson [appellant’s witness] seemed to think that more water had come down the west alley, east-and-west alley. I mean to a point west of the premises, and the area around east and west, probably than any other direction. But I do not think so, and I won’t stop to refer to it. I think one of the pho'tographs taken so indicates. You can almost see the heavy burden of water that came down’ along the north side of 102d Street.. The water in there, those pictures show the presence of water there, and convince me further of the actual presence of an unusual quantity of water; and that is confirmed as well by the testimony of both the plaintiff and his neighbor across the way. The neighbor’s testimony is not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\n“But the conclusive and elemental fact is that there was an excess of water which was not in accordance with the prior experience of the neighborhood within recent years, or at least that is the testimony. And he is also confronted with the fact that it should fall in exact coincidence with the preliminary construction of the water-pipe line and a rather heavy fall of rain, which followed in the succeeding month.”\nWhile the direction of the flow of the water is not as clearly discernible from the pictures as might be desired, nevertheless, if we assume respondent’s conclusion that the water nearly all flowed onto respondent’s property from North 102nd street to be correct, there would still not be sufficient evidence to support finding No. VII as to the cause of the flooding. The burden was upon respondent to prove that the city changed the contours of North 102nd street and that this change caused the flooding. The most favorable view of the evidence from respondent’s standpoint amounts to no more than a mere possibility that the flooding might have been caused in this manner. This is insufficient to support the trial court’s finding.\nIn Home Ins. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 18 Wn. (2d) 798, 140 P. (2d) 507, we had occasion to consider a rule of law which is applicable to the present case. We there said:\n“The rule is well established that the existence of a fact or facts cannot rest in guess, speculation, or conjecture. It is also the rule that the one having the affirmative of an issue does not have to make proof to an absolute certainty. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the thing in question, such as the occurrence of a fire, happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged therewith than it is that it happened in a way for which a person charged would not be liable. In applying the circumstantial evidence submitted to prove a fact, the trier of fact must recognize the distinction between that which is mere conjecture and what is a reasonable inference.”\nMore recently, in Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wn. (2d) 802, 180 P. (2d) 564, the same principle was stated briefly as follows:\n“We have frequently said that, if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred.”\nThis rule is equally applicable whether the trier of fact be a jury or a court sitting without a jury.\nSince w¿ find from the record that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court’s finding that the city changed the contour of North 102nd street in such a manner as to be the proximate cause of the flooding, the respondents are not entitled to any recovery as against the appellant upon either the theory of negligence or upon the theory of the city’s damaging of their property for a public use. To recover upon the latter theory, there must be a showing that the acts of appellant resulted in the damaging of respondents’ property for such purpose. The evidence applicable to this theory is insufficient to bring this case within the scope of our decision in Whiteside v. Benton County, 114 Wash. 463, 195 Pac. 519, and other similar cases cited by respondent.\nThe judgment is reversed, with directions to dismiss the action.\nSchwellenbach, Hill, Grady, and Hamley, JJ., concur."""
1095193,"Thomas v. Housing Authority","""Finley, C. J.\nOne morning, Carrie Thomas, then age 18 months — now the minor plaintiff in this lawsuit — was playing in the low-rent, 1-bedroom apartment which her parents leased from the defendant public housing authority. Her mother was not feeling well and was taking a nap in the bedroom. Carrie’s 17-year-old uncle, Floyd Grubs, was engaged in washing and rinsing dishes in a mixture of hot and cold water. Suddenly Carrie screamed. Her young uncle rushed into the bathroom. He found the child standing beside a small pool of water which had overflowed from the washbasin. Her nightgown was soaking wet on the left side. Water so hot it approached boiling temperature filled the basin. The hot-water faucet handle was too hot to touch. Apparently Carrie had climbed up, turned on the faucet, and fallen into the washbasin after it had filled with water. The entire left side of her body was severely scalded. Second and third degree burns and permanent injuries resulted.\nCarrie Thomas and her parents had moved into their low-rent apartment unit some 4 months before the accident. It was one of 582 living units in the project known as West Park, operated by the defendant public housing authority. The Thomases’ written lease with defendant contained, inter alia, the following provisions:\nLiability — The Management shall not be responsible for loss or damage to property, nor injury to persons, occuring [sic] in or about the demised premises, by reason of any existing or future condition, defect, matter or thing in said demised premises or the property of which the premises are a part, nor for the acts, omissions or negligence of other persons or Tenants in and about the said property. The Tenant agrees to indemnify and save the Management, its representatives and employees harmless from all claims and liability for damage to property or injuries to persons occuring [sic] in or about the demised premises\nTenant’s Responsibilities\nb. Entry — The Management may enter the premises during all reasonable time for inspection or repairs, or to remove signs, alterations or additions placed on the premises without permission.\nc. Damage — The tenant shall notify the Management immediately of necessary repairs or of damage to buildings or fixtures.\nThe heating appliance which furnished hot water for the Thomases’ apartment was about 22 years old at the time of the accident. A small plate or cover on the side of the water heater bore a legend reading “remove plate for adjustment.” Underneath the cover was a set screw which in effect operated as a lever to adjust the thermostat and the temperature of the water from extreme “hot” to extreme “cold” or some intermediate point. At the time plaintiff suffered her injuries, the mechanism was set all the way to the “hot” position. Even if the mechanism had been set at a lower or colder temperature reading, nevertheless, the water temperature actually produced could have been extremely hot. This is because the set screw could be unscrewed, moved, and reset to vary and to make the entire temperature range either higher or lower. Testimony introduced at the trial was capable of supporting a jury finding that no one checked the position of the set screw or the temperature range of the water before Carrie and her parents moved into the apartment, nor while they resided there. Three times during the period in which the Thomases resided in the apartment, defendant’s maintenance man serviced the water heater at the Thomases’ request. The servicing consisted of cleaning out soot, adjusting the air on the burner, and, on one occasion, relighting the pilot light; but it did not entail checking or changing the thermostat adjustment.\nThe water heater in question was tested after the accident. On the hottest setting, it produced water ranging from 180 to 208 degrees fahrenheit. On six arbitrarily chosen lower settings, it produced lower ranges of temperature down to 122 to 126 degrees on the lowest setting, with the one exception that it once produced water of 200 degrees on the middle setting after the burner was left on overnight. Expert testimony produced at the trial tended to show that, based on the distortion of a plastic toothbrush which had been in the washbasin, the water which scalded Carrie was approximately 200 degrees fahrenheit, or hotter.\nThis lawsuit was instituted by her guardian ad litem alleging that her injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant-appellant public housing authority. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff upon which judgment was entered, and the defendant appeals contending it is entitled to a judgment of dismissal as a matter of law. Defendant-appellant’s three assignments of error raise three questions which we will now discuss:\nFirst, the defendant housing authority maintains that it was under no duty to prevent the injuries posed in plaintiff’s complaint; i.e., it is not chargeable with negligence because the occurrence of the accident was not reasonably foreseeable. Anderson v. Reeder, 42 Wn.2d 45, 253 P.2d 423 (1953), and Fritsche v. Seattle, 10 Wn.2d 357, 116 P.2d 562 (1941), stand for the unquestioned proposition that when an accident occurs which is not reasonably foreseeable and which, according to common experience, is not likely to happen, a defendant is not chargeable with negligence. However, for a defendant to be held liable for maintaining a dangerous condition, proof as to foreseeability of the particular manner or nature of the occurrence is not necessary. It is sufficient if the general type of danger is reasonably foreseeable. Fleming v. Seattle, 45 Wn.2d 477, 275 P.2d 904 (1954).\nThe defendant’s maintenance superintendent admitted on the witness stand that water even as hot as 180 degrees fahrenheit was dangerously hot. The fact that he considered it dangerous clearly implies that he could foresee that people could be exposed to it long enough to cause injury. This seems particularly pertinent in view of the well known fact that many small children were living in the low-rent public housing project.\nAs indicated hereinbefore, there was substantial evidénce produced at the trial to support a jury determination that the water which scalded Carrie was 200 degrees fahrenheit, or hotter. There was also evidence that the defendant’s maintenance employees knew that the hot water from this type of hot water tank could and did reach 200 degrees, and hotter, when the thermostat was out of adjustment or the lever was on the highest setting. It should reasonably have been known to the defendant’s agents that exposure to water of that heat even momentarily could cause serious injuries. Tending to support a conclusion that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were a foreseeable consequence of the overly hot water is our decision in Kidwell v. School Dist. No. 300, 53 Wn.2d 672, 335 P. 2d 805 (1959). Therein, this court held that an injury to a child which occurred in the moving of a precariously balanced, high upright piano in a school activities room was sufficiently foreseeable to sustain liability.\nWe find further support for concluding that the injuries were reasonably foreseeable in a case involving a somewhat analogous factual pattern. In Thompson v. Paseo Manor South, Inc., 331 S.W.2d 1 (Mo. App. 1959), a 22-month-old child fell from her bed and came into contact with uninsulated and unprotected heating pipes which caused injuries for which suit was brought against the landlord. In reversing a judgment for the defendant landlord, the court, 331 S.W.2d at 6-7, made the following observation in regard to foreseeability:\nIt may be conceded that this child falling from its bed and becoming entangled in the pipes and receiving the injuries complained of was an unusual occurrence. But the landlord knew that the child occupied the apartment, and no doubt knew of children occupying other similar apartments. It is not the unusual manner of receiving injuries that determines liability, but whether the defendant could have reasonably anticipated that a child would receive injuries from the pipes. In Hammontree v. Edison Bros. Stores, Inc., Mo. App., 270 S.W.2d 117, 126, it is said: “Relating to those dangers to be reasonably anticipated — if there is some probability or likelihood, not a mere possibility, of harm sufficiently serious that ordinary men would take precautions to avoid it, then the failure to do so is negligence. While the likelihood of a future happening is the test of a duty to anticipate, this does not mean the chances in favor of the happening must exceed those against it. The test is not the balance of probabilities, but of the existence of some probability of sufficient moment to induce the reasonable mind to take the precautions which would avoid it.” (Italics ours.)\nWe think that the evidentiary pattern of the instant case meets the test or standard for establishing liability, i.e., the overly hot water posed a danger to tenants and children of tenants of the housing project which was sufficiently foreseeable to support a determination of liability. See also Housinq Authority of Birmingham v. Morris, 244 Ala. 557, 14 So. 2d 527 (1943).\nNext, the defendant maintains that assuming the water was excessively hot, it is not liable under applicable landlord-tenant law. The defendant cites such cases as Flannery v. Nelson, 59 Wn.2d 120, 366 P.2d 329 (1961), and Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092 (1913), for the proposition that a landlord is not liable for an obvious or patent defect, and is only liable for an obscure or latent defect, if he has actual knowledge of it. Conceding this to be a fair statement of the law of Washington and of some other states, nevertheless in many other jurisdictions, actual knowledge of the landlord is not required as the basis of liability if he has knowledge of facts which would lead a reasonable man to suspect the defect actually exists.\nAssuming our landlord and tenant law to be as indicated above, we are convinced the evidence in this case shows an obscure or latent defect or dangerous condition existed. Dr. Botimer testified that, in his opinion, if the water had been 140 degrees fahrenheit instead of 200 degrees, Carrie would not have suffered severe second and third degree burns on the entire left side of her body nor lost three fingers as she did, i.e., her injuries, if any, would have been very minor. From the testimony of various witnesses, the jury could have found that there is no way for the average person to tell the difference between water of 140 degrees fahrenheit and water heated to 200 degrees fahrenheit without using a high range thermometer, which the average person does not have and would not think of using. The verdict indicates a jury determination that the hot water heater or its condition at the time constituted an obscure or latent dangerous condition. A sufficient basis was laid relating to the issue involved, and the question was properly submitted to the jury for its determination. Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 75 Wash. 255, 134 Pac. 927 (1913).\nThere is some dispute about the extent or the character of the knowledge of the defect necessary to render the defendant liable under existing law. The plaintiff points out that the type of water heater involved was installed throughout the housing project, and emphasizes evidence showing that the maintenance men of the defendant knew that this type of water heater could produce dangerously hot water. It is further emphasized that tenants sometimes unwittingly altered the temperature range of the heaters and that the projects’ hot water faucets thus on occasion produced not only water too hot for safe domestic use but even live steam. Plaintiff then cites Carusi v. Schulmerick, 98 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir. 1938), wherein the landlord’s agents knew of a latent defect in a particular type of window installed throughout an apartment building. The court seems to have held such knowledge was sufficient to render the landlord liable when, because of its dangerous condition, one such window fell and injured the plaintiff.\nContrariwise, the defendant cites Daulton v. Williams, 81 Cal. App. 2d 70, 183 P.2d 325 (1947). We do not find that case to be apposite. The court in Daulton specifically stated that the defect involved was a patent one.\nIn any event, we do not find it necessary to decide whether the defendant possessed the requisite knowledge solely on the basis of its knowledge as to the dangerous condition inherent in this type of water heater.\nThere was testimony that Floyd Grubs, while living in the Thomases’ apartment, had complained to defendant’s maintenance man that the water in the apartment was too hot. This was a month or two before the accident and at a time when the maintenance man was cleaning the water heater in question. Neither Grubs nor the Thomases had reason to know how hot too hot was, but the defendant’s maintenance personnel had good reason to know that too hot could be dangerously hot. There was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to conclude that the defendant had actual knowledge of the defect or dangerous conditions. See Howard v. Washington Power Co., supra.\nBeing aware of the danger, the defendant at the very least could have taken the following simple and economically feasible precautions: (1) check the temperature of the water produced by each water heater in the course of the regular between-tenants inspection of the apartments, and (2) advise all tenants, particularly new ones on their entry, to be careful regarding the hot water in the apartments and especially not to change the screw setting on the thermostat since this could cause the water to be heated to a dangerously hot temperature. Defendant took none of these steps in regard to the Thomases or the water heater in their apartment. Having failed to discharge its responsibility, the defendant must bear the consequences.\nThe defendant’s third argument is that the provision of the lease, quoted above, which relates to liability is effective to release it from liability for Carrie’s injuries. In support of the validity of this exculpatory clause, the defendant cites this court’s decisions in Magerstaedt v. Eric Co., 64 Wn.2d 298, 391 P.2d 533 (1964); Griffiths v. Henry Broder ick, Inc., 27 Wn.2d 901, 182 P.2d 18, 175 A.L.R. 1 (1947); and Broderson v. Rainier Nat’l Park Co., 187 Wash. 399, 60 P.2d 234 (1936). In the Griffiths case, the court held that an agreement by which a private apartment house owner held the manager harmless from liability for injuries resulting from any cause, including its own negligence, was not contrary to public policy. Because of the difference in the character and relationship of the parties to the agreement in Griffiths, that case is not determinative of the issue here presented.\nNeither is the Broderson case apposite, since there the issue concerned the validity of a release of liability clause whereby the defendant, which rented winter sports equipment, protected itself against liability to those patrons who voluntarily chose to participate in dangerous winter sports. We note, however, that the opinion in Broderson, 187 Wash, at 404, contains the following language:\nConsidering the question whether the waiver was void as against public policy, it is a well-recognized rule that corporations engaged in the performance of public duties, as for instance, common carriers, and, generally, those engaged in the operation of public utilities, cannot by contract relieve themselves of liability for negligence in the performance of their duty to the public or the measure of care they owe their patrons under the law. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Chicago M. & S.P.R. Co., 175 U.S. 91, 20 S. Ct. 33; Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 84 U.S. 357.\nIn the Magerstaedt decision, there is language which supports the validity of a lease provision relieving the corporate lessor from liability to the lessee of a restaurant for certain causes, although the exculpatory clause was not the basis of the decision in that case. The landlord-tenant relationship in that case, however, was quite different than in the instant matter.\nThe Laws of 1939, ch. 23, now codified as RCW 35.82, created the defendant public housing authority and enabled it to build and operate the West Park project in which the Thomases lived. It is noteworthy that RCW 35.82.010 reads in part as follows:\nFinding and declaration of necessity. It is 'hereby declared: (1) that there exist in the state insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations and that persons of low income are forced to reside in such insanitary or unsafe accommodations; that within the state there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; . . . (2) that these areas in the state cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved, through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income (as herein defined) would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise; (3) that the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which insanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern; ....\nThe definition of “housing project,” as found in RCW 35.82.020, contains the following language:\n(9) “Housing project” shall mean any work or undertaking: . . . (b) to provide decent, safe and sanitary urban or rural dwellings, apartments or other living accommodations for persons of low income; ....\nFrom this expression of the legislature, the conclusion is inescapable that two of the primary objectives in creating public housing authorities such as the defendant are: (1) to provide safe and sanitary housing, and (2) to make such housing available to persons of low income who otherwise would be forced to reside in unsanitary and unsafe housing.\nPublic housing such as that provided by the defendant is only available to “persons of low income,” in other words, those who the legislature has determined are unable to obtain safe and sanitary housing elsewhere. The situation presents a classic example of unequal bargaining power. Dean Prosser analyzes the problem and the applicable law as follows:\nIt is quite possible for the parties expressly to agree that the defendant is under no obligation of care for the benefit of the plaintiff, and shall not be liable for the consequences of conduct which would otherwise be negligence. There is no public policy which prevents the parties from contracting as they see fit. Thus one who accepts a gratuitous pass on a railway train, or enters into a lease or some other relation, may agree that there shall be no responsibility for negligence.\nThe courts have refused to uphold such agreements, however, where one party is at such obvious disadvantage in bargaining power that the effect of the contract is to put him at the mercy of the other’s negligence. Prosser, Torts § 55, at 305-06 (2d ed. 1955). (Italics ours.)\nWe think that the instant matter, in which the Thomases had to sign the defendant’s standard lease form in order to acquire housing at West Park, is an example of an obvious disadvantage in bargaining power which would have the effect, if the exculpatory provision were upheld, of putting the tenants at the mercy of the defendant housing authority’s negligence. This would be contrary to the public policy inherent in the basic legislation and authorization relative to low rent public housing.\nIn support of its position on the validity of the exculpatory provision in the lease, the defendant also cites Manius v. Housing Authority of Pittsburgh, 350 Pa. 512, 39 A.2d 614 (1944). The Manius case did uphold a release clause in a lease between a tenant and a public housing authority against a challenge that it was void as against public policy. The Pennsylvania court did not give much consideration to the argument, however, and dismissed it rather summarily in a brief paragraph.\nIn Housing Authority of Birmingham v. Morris, 244 Ala. 557, 14 So.2d 527 (1943), the Supreme Court of Alabama held that a disclaimer of liability by a housing authority is not effective to insulate it from liability to its tenants for its own negligence. Curiously enough, the Morris case also involved a plaintiff who was scalded by hot water, the injury being caused by the defendant’s negligent maintenance of a hot water heater. On rehearing, the court unanimously adhered to its prior opinion and concluded that the housing authority could not be allowed to “create and maintain a trap to inflict personal injury upon its tenants.” 14 So.2d at 535. The careful and exhaustive analysis of the Alabama court was based in part on consideration of the statutes which authorized and created the housing authority. These statutes, which the court quoted at length and which are very similar to those of this state found in RCW 35.82, emphasized that the purpose of the housing projects was to provide safe and sanitary housing for persons of low income. We believe the Morris decision is better and more carefully reasoned than that in Manius.\nWe conclude that it is against the public policy of this state, as expressed by the legislature, to allow a public housing authority, created to provide safe and sanitary housing for persons of low income, to exempt itself by prearrangement or contract from liability to its tenants for its own negligence.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nDonworth, Rosellini, and Hamilton, JJ., and Barnett, J. Pro Tern., concur.\nSee, e.g., Wagner v. Kepler, 411 Ill. 368, 104 N.E.2d 231 (1951); Harrill v. Sinclair Ref. Co., 225 N.C. 421, 35 S.E.2d 240 (1945); Murphy v. Barlow Realty Co., 214 Minn. 64, 7 N.W.2d 684 (1943); Hines v. Wilcox, 96 Tenn. 148, 33 S.W. 914 (1896); Cutter v. Hamlen, 147 Mass. 471, 18 N.E. 397 (1888); and other cases and authorities cited in 2 Harper & James, Torts § 27.16, at 1509, nn. 16 and 17 (1956). Dean Prosser considers the requirement of actual knowledge to be the minority view. Prosser, Torts § 80, at 467 (2d ed. 1955). In the view of the Restatement (Second), Torts § 358 (1) (1965), liability attaches if “the lessor knows or has reason to know of the condition, and realizes or should realize the risk involved, and has reason to expect that the lessee will not discover the condition or realize the risk.” (Italics ours.)\nIt is also clear that the legislature had no intention of shielding housing authorities such as the defendant from suit, RCW 35.82.070 provides in part:\n2 Powers of authority. An authority shall constitute a public body corporate and politic, exercising public and essential governmental functions, and having all the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter, including the following powers in addition to others herein granted: (1) To sue and be sued; ....\nAnother case in. which an exculpatory clause in a lease with a public housing authority was before an appellate court is Harper v Vallejo Housing Authority, 104 Cal. App. 2d 621, 232 P.2d 262 (1951). In that case, the court affirmed a judgment for the minor plaintiff in spite of the release provision in the lease. The court was not called upon to determine the validity of the provision, however, as the suit was only for the child’s injuries and the court determined the release to be ineffective to contract away the minor plaintiff’s rights."""
